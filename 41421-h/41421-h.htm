<p>Transcriber's Note:</p>

<p>The text is divided into 5 "Conferences" and 41 sections.</p>

<p>Marginal notes indicating the start of individual sections have been
converted into section headings. Other notes have been numbered and
moved to the end of each Conference. They often refer to the following
(rather than preceding) passage, and if so are positioned accordingly.
The locations of the marker for Note 13, and of the start of Section
8, are unclear: they have been inserted in accordance with the sense
of the text.</p>

<p>Other markers that do not correspond to marginal notes have been
removed. The "*" that are retained in sections 11, 13 and 18 do not
indicate marginal notes, but instead function as bullet points.</p>

<p>Variations in spelling have been retained with the exception of the
following:</p>

<ul>

<li>Conference 1 Summary: "byass'd" changed to "bypass'd".</li>
<li>Conference 2 Section 17: "be-belief" changed to "belief" and
"absolure" to "absolute".</li>
<li>Conference 5 Section 36 "enent" changed to "tenent"; Section 37
"Athenasian" changed to "Athanasian".</li>

</ul>

<p>Obscured text has been transcribed as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Conference 1 Section 8: "?her" transcribed as "Luther".</li>
<li>Conference 3 Section 18: the sentence beginning "But if it be
said" has been reconstructed from the work cited.</li>
<li>Conference 5 Section 30: the phrases "not-conforming to" and "As
to Charity" have been reconstructed.</li>

</ul>

<p>At the beginning of Conference 1 a brace, extending over several
lines, has been replaced by a column of individual braces.</p>

<p>For technical reasons drop capitals have been removed from
Conference summaries; and numbering removed, before drop capitals, at
the start of each Conference text.</p>

<p>When a word in italics is followed by "'s" the latter may or may
not be italicised. This inconsistency has been retained. Inconsistent
hyphenation has also been retained.</p>

<p>The Text has been corrected in accordance with the Errata section.
Mismatched brackets and parentheses have been removed and apparent
punctuation errors corrected.</p>

<h3>§. 1.</h3>

<p class="cap">TO shew the invalidity of such a Guide as Protestants
have framed to themselves for preserving the true Faith, and
suppressing Heresies, hath for several years been the Subject of
divers Modern Pens: But, because Instances and Examples, seem to some,
more weighty and convincing, it is thought fit (the more to awaken,
and the better to satisfie him) here to let the Reader see what
Apology a <i>Socinian</i> (who tho' denying the Trinity, and our
Saviors Deity, yet, most zealously urges Scripture, and its plainness
in all necessaries, as if it justified his own Errors; or that he
Erred only in matters not necessary) upon the Protestant Principles
may return for himself to a Protestant endeavouring to reduce him to
the true Faith and the <i>Nicene</i> Creed; and using any of these
five Motives thereto, <i>viz.</i> The Testimony of 1. Scripture. 2.
Catholic-Church-Authority. 3. Councils, with the Danger and Guilt of
4. Heresie, and 5. Schism. Not intending hereby to equal all
Protestant Opinions with the <i>Socinian</i>; but inferring that these
Pleas as relating to these Motives will as rationally justifie the
<i>Socinian</i> as the Protestant.<br /><br /></p>

<p>For, suppose a Protestant, first, concerning the <i>Scriptures</i>,
question a <i>Socinian</i> in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Why do you, to the great danger of your soul, and
salvation, not believe, <i>God the Son to be of one, and the same
essence, and substance with God the Father</i>, it being so principal
an Article of the <i>Christian</i> Faith, delivered in the <i>Holy
Scriptures</i>?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> To give you a satisfactory account of this matter. I do
believe, with other Christians, that the Scriptures are the Word of
God; and, with other Protestants, that they are a perfect <i>Rule</i>
of my faith.</p>

<h3><a name="S_2" id="S_2">§. 2.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But, this secures you not, unless you believe according
to this <i>Rule</i>; which in this point, you do not.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> However I believe in this point; truly, or falsly; I am
secure that my Faith is entire, as to all <i>necessary</i> points of
Faith.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Because, as M. <i>Chillingworth</i> saith<a
name="R_1" id="R_1" href="#N_1" class="nanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;<i>He
that believes all that is in the</i> Bible, <i>all that is in the</i>
Scriptures (<i>as I do</i>) <i>believes all that is</i> necessary
<i>there</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> This must needs be true: but mean while, if there be
either some part of Scripture not known at all by you; or the true
sense of some part of that you know (for, <i>the Scripture</i>, as
that Author notes<a name="R_2" id="R_2" href="#N_2"
class="nanchor">[2]</a>, <i>is not so much the words, as the
sense</i>) be mistaken by you, how can you say, you believe all the
Scriptures? For, when you say, you believe all the Scripture, you mean
only this: that you believe, that, whatsoever is the <i>true sense</i>
thereof, that is <i>God's Word</i>; and most certainly true: which
belief of yours doth very well consist with your not believing, or
also your believing the contrary to the <i>true sense</i> thereof: and
then you, not believing the true sense of some part of it at least,
may also not believe the true sense of something <i>necessary</i>
there; which is quite contrary to your conclusion here.</p>

<h3><a name="S_3" id="S_3">§. 3.</a></h3>

<p><i>Soc.</i> <a
name="R_3" id="R_3" href="#N_3" class="nanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>I
believe, that that sense of them which God intendeth whatsoever it is,
is certainly true; And thus I believe implicitely even those very
truths, against which I err.</i> Next: <a
name="R_4" id="R_4" href="#N_4" class="nanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>I
do my</i> best endeavour <i>to believe Scripture in the true sense thereof.
By my best endeavour I mean</i><a
name="R_5" id="R_5" href="#N_5" class="nanchor">[5]</a>, <i>such a measure
of industry, as humane prudence, and ordinary discretion</i> (<i>my
abilities, and opportunities, my distractions, and hindrances, and all
other things considered</i>) <i>shall advise me unto in a matter of such
consequence.</i> Of <i>using</i> which <i>endeavour</i> also, I conceive, I may be
sufficiently certain: [for otherwise, I can have no certainty of any
thing I believe from this compleat Rule of Scriptures; this due
endeavor being the condition, which Protestants require, that I shall
not be, as to all necessaries, deceived in the sense of Scripture.]
Now, being conscious to my self of such a right endeavor used: <a
name="R_6" id="R_6" href="#N_6" class="nanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>For
me, to believe, further, this or that to be the true sense of some
Scriptures; or to believe the true sense of them, and to avoid the
false, is not necessary, either to my faith or salvation. For, if God
would have had his meaning in these places certainly known, how could
it stand with his wisdom, to be so wanting to his own will and end, as
to speak obscurely? Or how can it consist with his justice to require
of men to know certainly the meaning of those words which he himself
hath not revealed?</i> <a
name="R_7" id="R_7" href="#N_7" class="nanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>For
my error or ignorance in what is not plainly contained in Scripture,
after my best endeavour used; to say that God will damn me for such
errors, who am a lover of him, and lover of truth, is to rob man of
his comfort, and God of his goodness; is to make man desperate, and
God a Tyrant.</i></p>

<h3><a name="S_4" id="S_4">§. 4.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But this defence will no way serve your turn for all
points of Faith revealed in Scripture: for you ought to have of some
points an <i>express</i> and <i>explicite</i> Faith.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Of what points?</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Of all those that are <i>fundamental</i> and
<i>necessary</i>.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Then if this point of <i>Consubstantiality of the Son
with God the Father</i> be none of the <i>Fundamentals</i>, and
necessaries, wherein I am to have a right and an explicite Faith, the
account I have given you already, I hope, is satisfactory.</p>

<h3>§. 5.</h3>

<p>But next: I am secure, that this point, which is the subject of our
discourse, at least in the affirmative thereof, is no fundamental;
for, according to the Protestant principles <a name="R_8" id="R_8"
href="#N_8" class="nanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>The Scripture is a
Rule, as sufficiently perfect, so sufficiently intelligible in things
necessary, to all that have understanding; whether learned, or
unlearned. Neither is any thing necessary to be believed, but what is
plainly revealed: for to say, that when a place of Scripture by reason
of ambiguous terms lies indifferent between divers senses, whereof one
is true, and the other false, that God obligeth men under pain of
damnation not to mistake through error, and humane frailty, is to make
God a Tyrant, and to say that he requires of us certainty to attain
that end, for the attaining whereof we have no certain means. In
fine,</i> <a name="R_9" id="R_9" href="#N_9" class="nanchor">[9]</a>
<i>where Scriptures are plain, as they are in necessaries, they need
no infallible Interpreter, no further explanation</i> [to me]; <i>and
where they are not plain, there if I, using diligence to find the
truth, do yet miss of it, and fall into Error, there is no danger in
it.</i></p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> True. Such necessary points are clear to the
unlearned, using a due Industry, void of a contrary interest,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> And in such industry I may be assured, I have not been
deficient, having bestowed much study on this matter, read the
Controversie on both sides; compared Texts, <i>&amp;c.</i> (as also
appears in the diligent writings of others of my perswasion); and
after all this, the sense of Scripture also, which I embrace, (a
sense, you know, decried and persecuted by most Christians) is very
contrary to all my secular relations, interest, and profit.</p>

<h3><a name="S_6" id="S_6">§. 6.</a></h3>

<p>Now, after all this search I have used, I am so far satisfied,
that this point, on the affirmative side, is not clear, and
evident in Scripture (and therefore no Fundamental) that I
can produce most clear and evident places out of the Scriptures
(if a man can be certain of any thing from the perspicuity of
its Expressions) that the contrary of it is so.</p>

<p>[See <i>Crellius</i> in the Preface to his Book <i>De uno Deo
Patre</i>,&mdash;&mdash;<i>Hæc de uno Deo Patre sententia</i>
plurimis, <i>ac</i> clarissimis <i>sacrarum literarum testimoniis
nititur</i>&mdash;&mdash;Evidens <i>sententiæ veritas, &amp;
rationum</i> firmissimarum <i>è sacris literis spontè
subnascentium</i> multitudo, <i>ingenii nostri tenuitatem sublevat,
&amp;c.</i>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Argumenta, quæ ex sacris literis
deprompsimus, per se</i> plana <i>sunt, ac</i> facilia <i>adeo quidem,
ut eorum vim declinare aliâ ratione non possint adversarii, quam ut â
verborum simplicitate tum ipsi deflectant, tum nos abducere
conentur.</i> And see the particular places of Scripture which they
urge (where, as to the expression, and other Texts being laid aside,
that seems to be said, as it were <i>totidem verbis</i>, which the
Socinians maintain), <i>Joh.</i> 14.&nbsp;28. 17.&nbsp;3. <i>Ep.</i> 1
<i>Cor.</i> 8.&nbsp;6.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Col.</i> 1.&nbsp;15. <i>&amp;
Rev.</i> 3.&nbsp;14. I set not down this to countenance their Cause,
but to shew their Confidence.]</p>

<h3>§. 7.</h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> O strange Presumption! And is not your judgment, then,
liable to mistake in the true sense of these Scriptures, because you
strongly persuade your self, they are most evident on your side?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> 'Tis true, that I may <i>mistake</i> in the sense of <i>some</i>
Scripture; but it follows not from hence, that I can be <i>certain</i> of
the sense of <i>no</i> Scriptures. To answer you in the words of Mr.
<i>Chillingworth</i><a
name="R_10" id="R_10" href="#N_10" class="nanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Tho'
I pretend not to certain means in interpreting all Scripture,
particularly such places as are obscure and ambiguous; yet this
methinks should be no impediment, but that we may have certain means
of not erring in, and about the sense of those places which are so
plain and clear, that they need no Interpreters; and in such this my
Faith is contained. If you ask me, how I can he sure, that I know the
true meaning of these places? I ask you again; Can you be sure you
understand what I, or any man else saith; They that heard our Saviour
and the Apostles Preach, can they have sufficient assurance that they
understood at any time what they would have them do? If not, to what
end did they hear them? If they could, why may not I be as well
assured, that I understand sufficiently, what I conceive plain in
their Writings?</i> Again; I pray tell me, whether do you certainly know
the sense of these Scriptures, for the evidence of which you separated
from the Church that was before <i>Luther</i>, requiring conformity to the
contrary Doctrines, as a condition of her Communion? <i>If you do, then
give us leave to have the same means, and the same abilities to know
other plain places, which you have to know these. For if all the
Scripture be obscure, how can you know the sense of these places? If
some places of it be plain, why should I stay here?</i>&mdash;&mdash;<a
name="R_11" id="R_11" href="#N_11" class="nanchor">[11]</a> <i>If you ask,
seeing I may possibly err, how can I be assured I do not? I ask you
again, seeing your eyesight may deceive you, how can you be sure you
see the Sun, when you do see it?</i> <a
name="R_12" id="R_12" href="#N_12" class="nanchor">[12]</a> <i>A
Judge may possibly err in Judgment, can he therefore never have
assurance that he hath judged rightly? a Traveller may possibly
mistake his way; must I therefore be doubtful whether I am in the
right way from my Hall to my Chamber? Or can our</i> London <i>Carrier have
no certainty in the middle of the day, when he is sober, and in his
wits, that he is in his way to</i> London?<a
name="R_13" id="R_13" href="#N_13" class="nanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;<i>This
I am certain of, that God will not require of me a certainly unerring
belief, unless he had given me a certain means to avoid error, and if
I use those which I have, will never require of me, that I use that
which I have not</i><a
name="R_14" id="R_14" href="#N_14" class="nanchor">[14]</a>.&mdash;&mdash;This
is Mr. <i>Chillingworth</i>'s solid Plea, against the Papist's grand
Objection, for the proving an uncertainty in the Protestant's Faith
upon any their pretence of <i>evident</i> Scripture.</p>

<h3><a name="S_8" id="S_8">Sect. 8.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But the Scriptures, which you urge against <i>the
Son's being the same one only God with God the Father</i>, carry not
the same evidence and clearness, as those Scriptures do, whereon
Protestants build the certainty of their Faith against the Papists, or
against the common Church-Doctrines that were before <i>Luther</i>.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> That say the Papists of your plain Scriptures, which
you of mine: I pray, what can be said more plain, or in what point, in
your Opinion, more fundamental (wherein we contend Scripture is most
clear, even to the unlearned), than this, in <i>Joh.</i>
17.&nbsp;3.&mdash;<i>Ut cognoscant te</i> [Pater] <i>solum verum Deum;
&amp;, quem misisti, Jesum Christum</i>&mdash;And, 1 <i>Cor.</i>
8.&nbsp;6. <i>Unus Deus, Pater; &amp; unus Dominus, Jesus.</i> And,
<i>Eph.</i> 4. <i>ver.</i> 5. <i>Unus est Dominus</i>, [i. e.
<i>Jesus</i>;] and then, <i>ver.</i> 6. <i>Unus est Deus, &amp; Pater
omnium</i>&mdash;And, <i>Joh.</i> 14.&nbsp;1. <i>Creditis in Deum,
&amp; in me credite</i>&mdash;&mdash;And <i>v.</i> 28. <i>Pater meus
major me est.</i> I say, what more clear for proving the Father his
being the <i>true, most high</i> God, and excluding the other Persons
[the <i>Son</i>, or the <i>Holy Ghost</i>] from being the very same
God?</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> And 1. what more clear, on the other side, than these Texts,
<i>Rom.</i> 9.&nbsp;5. <i>Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who
is over all, God blessed for ever</i>&mdash;&mdash;And, <i>Tit.</i>
2.&nbsp;13. <i>The glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour
Jesus Christ.</i> And <a
name="R_15" id="R_15" href="#N_15" class="nanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;<i>we
are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the
true God and eternal life</i>, spoken by St. <i>John</i>, the great
vindicator, against <i>Ebion</i>, <i>Cerinthus</i>, <i>Carpocrates</i> and other, in
his time, opposers of our Lord's Divinity<a
name="R_16" id="R_16" href="#N_16" class="nanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;&mdash;And
<i>Apoc.</i> 1.&nbsp;8. compared with
1.&nbsp;17.&mdash;&mdash;<i>I am</i> Alpha <i>and</i> Omega, <i>the beginning and
the ending, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
Almighty</i>? I say, what more clear than these Texts, for shewing the
<i>true Deity</i> of Christ? 2. And then, how many other clear Texts are
there, asserting the <i>Eternity</i> of our Lord; that he is nothing made
or created, but pre-existent before the constitution of the World;
equal with God; and that Heaven, and Earth, and all things were made
by him, that were made; and that he descended from Heaven from his
Father, when he took our nature upon him? See <i>Joh.</i> 1.&nbsp;1.
&amp;c.&mdash;3.&nbsp;13. <i>Heb.</i> 1.&nbsp;2, 3, 10 &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Joh.</i>
17.&nbsp;5, 24.&mdash;<i>Phil.</i> 2.&nbsp;6.&mdash;<i>Joh.</i>
6.&nbsp;38.&mdash;&mdash;16.&nbsp;28.&mdash;&mdash;1. <i>Tim.</i>
3.&nbsp;16.&mdash;<i>Heb.</i> 2.&nbsp;14. And 3. then, his <i>Deity</i> and
<i>Eternity</i> thus cleared, his Deity can be no other, than, in the total
essence thereof, numerically the same with that of God the Father.
For, those of your own Sect, together with the whole Christian world,
do acknowledge, 1. That there is but one numerical most high God, an
inseparable attribute of whom is his Creating of the world, and
preexistence before it. And again; 2. That the substance or essence of
this most high God, is not any way divisible, partible or
multipliable; so that, <i>Si Christus ex Dei substantiâ generatus fuit,
tota ei Patris substantia, eadem numero, communicata fuit.</i> See
<i>Volkel. de vera Rel. l.</i> 5. <i>c.</i> 12. upon which consequence well
discerned, your predecessors were constrained to desert Arianism, or
semi-Arianism, and to take in other respects a more desperate way, of
denying any pre-existence of our Lord before his Incarnation: To
return then to our business. All Scripture being equally true; you
know, no Text thereof can be pronounced clear in such a sense, which
others, as clear contradict. The non-consideration of which by the
passionate or unlearned, is the mother of all errors. The Texts
therefore that you produce here so manifest on your side, that they
may not contradict many more others as clear against you, are to be
understood to speak of our Lord only according to his <i>Incarnation</i>,
<i>Messias</i> and <i>Mediatorship</i>, in which he hath an inferiority to the
Father and is our <i>Lord</i>, by a special Redemption with his blood, in
another manner, than He together with his Father, in the same essence,
is the one true God.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> All the Texts you have mentioned have been diligently
considered, and answered by our party.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> And your Answers are new, forced, absurd, as may
clearly appear to any rational and indifferent person perusing
<i>Volkelius</i> l. 5. from the 10. to the 14. Chapter. But to omit
this dispute, as now beside my purpose. If your sense of the
Scriptures, you have urged, be so manifest and clear, as you pretend;
how comes so great a part of the Christian world (doubtless rational
men), in the sense of these very Scriptures so much to differ from
you? Therefore here I cannot but still suppose in you the defect of a
<i>due industry</i>, well comparing these Scriptures, and void of
pride, passion, and other interest.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> And I return the like question to you. If, on the
clearness of the express sense of these Scriptures, I cannot
infallibly ground my faith, against many other rational men
contradicting; on what plainness of the sense of any other Scripture
is it, that Protestants can ground theirs against a contrary sense
given by the learned; by several Councils; by the whole Church of some
ages, as they do; not promising to the Councils, even to the four
first, an absolute, but conditional assent, <i>viz.</i> only so far,
as their Decrees agree with these clear Scriptures? If neither the
plain words of Scripture can afford a sufficient certainty to me in
this matter, which Scriptures, you say, in fundamentals are to all
perspicuous (and such do many deem this point); nor I can have a
sufficient assurance of using an unbiast industry in the understanding
of these Scriptures, and also in the comparing them with others, in
which I am conscious to my self of no neglect, I see no sufficient
ground of my presuming to understand any other part of Scripture; and
then, wherein can lye the assurance of a Protestant's Faith, for his
not erring in <i>Fundamentals</i> at least? Bishop <i>Lany</i> tells
me, <a name="R_17" id="R_17" href="#N_17" class="nanchor">[17]</a><i>That
when we have certain knowledge of a thing, we may safely learn
from the Schools,</i> viz. <i>Ubi non est formido contrarii; that
after diligent search and inquiry when there remains no scruple,
doubt, and fear of the contrary, when the understanding is fixt, we
are said to be certain&mdash;And that they who will say it, and do
think so too, may safely be absolved from the guilt of
disobedience.</i></p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> <a name="R_18" id="R_18" href="#N_18"
class="nanchor">[18]</a><i>You have a judgment of discretion I grant,
and may Interpret Scripture for your self: without the use of which
Judgment you cannot serve God with a reasonable service, who are also
to give account of your self, and are to be saved by your own Faith,
and do perish upon your own score.</i>&mdash;&mdash;<a name="R_19"
id="R_19" href="#N_19" class="nanchor">[19]</a><i>None may usurp that
royal prerogative of Heaven in prescribing infallibly in matters
questioned, but leave all to judge according to the Pandects of the
Divine Laws, because each Member of this Society is bound to take care
of his Soul, and of all things that tend thereto</i>&mdash;&mdash;<a
name="R_20" id="R_20" href="#N_20" class="nanchor">[20]</a><i>In
matters of Religion, when the question is, whether any man be a fit
judge, and chooser for himself, we suppose men honest, and such as
understand the difference between a moment and eternity. And then I
suppose that all the necessary points in Religion are plain and easie,
and consequently every man in this case to be a compleat Judge for
himself, because it concerns himself to Judge aright, as much as
eternal happiness is worth: and if through his own default he Judge
amiss, he alone shall suffer for it.</i> To God's righteous Judgment
therefore I must finally remit you. At your own peril be it. This, of
the Socinian's Plea concerning the Scripture on his side.</p>

<h3><a name="S_9" id="S_9">§. 9.</a></h3>

<p>Where the self-clearness of the sense of Scriptures, not mistakable
in Fundamentals, or necessaries, upon a due industry used (of which
also rightly used, men may be sufficiently assured,) being made the
ground, as you see, of the Protestants and Socinians Faith, before
these two proceed to any further conference, give me leave, to
interpose a word between them, concerning this certainty so much
spoken of, and presumed on.</p>

<h3>§. 10.</h3>

<p>And here first, from this way, lately taken by many Protestants, there
seems to be something necessarily consequent, which I suppose they
will by no means allow, <i>viz.</i> That instead of the Roman Church her
setting up some men, (the Church Governors,) as infallible in
necessaries, here is set up by them every Christian, if he will, both
infallible in all necessaries; and certain that he is so. For the
Scripture they affirm most clear in all necessaries to all using a due
industry, and of this due industry they also affirm, men may be
certain, that they have used it; being not all, <i>possible</i>, endeavour,
but such a measure thereof <i>as ordinary discretion</i>, &amp;c. <i>adviseth
to</i>. (See Mr. <i>Chillingworth</i>, p. 19.) And next, from this affirmed,
that every one may be so certain in all Fundamentals, it must be
maintained also, that their spiritual Guides, in a conjunction of
them, nay more, every single Prelate, or Presbyter, if they are not,
yet may be, an infallible Guide to the people in all Points necessary.
And therefore M. <i>Chillingworth</i> freely speaks to this purpose<a
name="R_21" id="R_21" href="#N_21" class="nanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>That
these also may be both in Fundamentals, and also in some points
unfundamental, both certain of the infallibility of their Rule, and
that they do manifestly proceed according to it: and then, in what
they are certain that they cannot be mistaken, they may</i> (saith he<a
name="R_22" id="R_22" href="#N_22" class="nanchor">[22]</a>) <i>lawfully
decide the controversies about them, and without rashness propose
their decrees, as</i> certain, divine <i>Revelations: and excommunicate or
anathematize any man persisting in the contrary error.</i> And there
seems reason in such <i>Anathema</i>; because all others either do or may
know the truth of the same decrees by the same certain means, as these
Governors do. Now then; what certainty the Guides of a particular
Church may have, I hope may also those of the Church Catholick: and
then, obedience being yielded to these by all their inferiors, this
will restore all things to their right course. All this follows upon
certainty, 1. That Scriptures are plain in Fundamentals; And 2. That
due industry is used to understand them. But, if you should deny that
men can have a <i>certainty</i> of their industry <i>rightly used</i>; then
again, is all the fair security these men promise their followers of
their not erring in necessaries quite vanished.</p>

<p>But now, to pass from this consequence, (to which I know not
what can be said), and to enquire a little after the true grounds
of our certainty in any thing, which is here so much pretended.</p>

<p>1. It cannot be denyed, that he that doth err in one thing, may be
certain, that he doth not err in some other; because he may have
sufficient ground and means for his not erring in one thing, which he
hath not in another. Nor again denied, that he, who possibly may err,
yet in the same thing may be certain, that he doth not err, if not
neglecting some means, which he knows will certainly keep him from
error.</p>

<h3>§. 11.</h3>

<p>2. But notwithstanding these: This seems also necessary to be granted
on the other side (and is so by learned Protestants,) That in what
kind of knowledge soever it be (whether of our <i>Sense</i> or <i>Reason</i>, in
whatever <i>Art</i> or <i>Science</i>) one can never <i>rightly</i> assure himself
concerning his own knowledge, that he is certain of any thing for a
<i>truth</i>, which all, or most others of the same or better abilities for
their cognoscitive faculties, in all the same external means, or
grounds of the knowledge thereof, do pronounce an <i>error</i>. Not, as if
truth were not so, though all the World oppose it; nor had certain
grounds to be proved so, though all the World should deny them; but
because the true knowledge of it, and them, cannot possibly appear to
one mans intellect, and, <i>omnibus paribus</i>, not to others. Now for any
disparity, as to defect, whether in the <i>instrument</i>, or in the
<i>means</i> of knowledge, there, where all or most differ from me, it
seems a strange pride not to imagine this defect in my self, rather
than them; especially, * whenas, all the grounds of my Science are
communicated to them; and * whenas, for my own mistakes, I cannot know
exactly the extent of supernatural delusions. I say, be this in what
knowledge we please; in that of sense, <i>seeing</i>, <i>hearing</i>,
<i>numbring</i>, or in any of Mr. <i>Chillingworth's</i> former instances
mentioned, §. 7. So, I can never rationally assure my self of what I
see, when men, as well or better sighted, and all external
circumstances for any thing I know being the same, see no such matter.
And this is the Rule also proposed by learned Protestants to keep
every Fanatick from pleading certainty in his own conceit. See
Arch-Bishop <i>Laud</i> (§. 33. Consid. 5. n. 1.)&mdash;&mdash;and <i>Hooker</i>
(Preface §. 6.) their designing of a clear evidence, or demonstrative
argument, <i>viz.</i> <i>Such as proposed to</i> any man, <i>and understood, the
mind cannot chuse but inwardly assent to it</i>; and therefore, surely,
proposed to many men, the mind of the most cannot dissent from it.</p>

<h3>§. 12.</h3>

<p>Consequently, in the Scripture; abstracting from the inward operations
of God's Holy Spirit, and any external infallible Guide, (which
infallible Guide Scripture it self cannot be to <i>two</i> men delivering a
contrary sense thereof:) I see not from whence any certainty can arise
to particular persons, for so many Texts or places thereof, concerning
the sense of which, the most, or the most learned, or their Superiors,
to whom also all their motives or arguments are represented, do differ
from them. From the plainness of the expression or Grammatical
construction of the words, such certainty cannot arise; unless no term
thereof can possibly be distinguished, or taken in a diverse or
unliteral sense; but, if it cannot be so taken, then all Expositors
must needs agree in one and the same sense. For Example, For the
<i>Literal</i> and <i>Grammatical</i> sense, what Text Plainer than [<i>Hoc est
corpus meum</i>]? and yet Protestants understand it otherwise. Very
deficient therefore seemeth that answer of Mr. <i>Chillingworth's</i> to
<i>F. Knot</i><a
name="R_23" id="R_23" href="#N_23" class="nanchor">[23]</a>, urging,
<i>That the first Reformers ought to have doubted, whether their
opinions were certain,&mdash;Which is to say</i> (answers he), <i>that they
ought to have doubted of the certainty of Scripture; which</i> in formal
and express terms, <i>contains many of their opinions</i> [whenas the
greater world of Catholicks sees no such matter.] Besides, as there is
no term almost in any sentence, but is capable of several acceptions;
so, since no falshood, no discord is in the Scriptures, there is no
sentence in it, however sounding for the expression, but must be
reconciled in its sense to all the rest; and for this a diligent
comparing of Texts is necessary, to attain the true meaning of many
places, that seem at the first sight most clear in what they say, but
that there are also other places as clear that seem to say the
contrary: And some such places they were, (and that in very necessary
points too) of which St. <i>Peter</i> saith; <i>That some wrested them to
their own damnation</i><a
name="R_24" id="R_24" href="#N_24" class="nanchor">[24]</a><i>:
wrested them</i>, because they wanted (not industry, but) learning;
<i>which the unlearned</i> (saith he) <i>wrest</i>&mdash;&mdash;And indeed
commonly the most ignorant have the strongliest-conceited certainty
for what they apprehend or believe, because they know fewest reasons
against it; whilst, by much study and comparing several Revelations
one with another, those come at last to doubt, or deny that sense of
some of them, which at the first they took for most certainly and
evidently true. Pardon this long Parenthesis.</p>

  <li><i>That supposing an unanimous consent

<h3><br /><a name="S_13" id="S_13">§. 13.</a></h3>

<p class="cap">NOw to resume the <i>Conference</i>. The
<i>Protestant</i>, better thinking on it, will not leave the Socinian
thus at rest in this plerophory of his own sense of Scripture, but
thus proceeds.</p>

<p><i>Prot. Scriptures</i> indeed are not so clear and perspicuous to
every one<a name="R_25" id="R_25" href="#N_25"
class="nanchor">[25]</a> <i>as that Art and subtilty may not be used
to pervert the Catholick doctrine, and to wrest the plain places of
Scripture which deliver it, so far from their proper meaning, that
very few ordinary capacities may be able to clear themselves of such
mists as are cast before their eyes, even</i> in the great Articles of
the Christian faith. Therefore why do not you submit your judgment,
and assent to <i>the sense of Scripture</i>, in this point
<i>unanimously delivered by the consent of the Catholick Church</i>;
which also is believed always unerrable in any necessary point of
faith, as this is?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> First, If you can shew me <i>an unanimous consent</i> of the Church
Catholick of all ages in this point, and that as held necessary, I
will willingly submit to it. But this you can never do according to
such a proof thereof, as is required, <i>viz.</i> <a
name="R_26" id="R_26" href="#N_26" class="nanchor">[26]</a><i>That
all Catholick Writers agree in the belief of it; and none of them
oppose it: and agree also in the belief of the necessity of it to all
Christians. * That no later Writers and Fathers, in opposition of
Hereticks, or heats of contention, judged then the Article so opposed
to be more necessary than it was judged before the contention. * That
all Writers, that give an account of the faith of Christians, deliver
it; And deliver it not as necessary to be believed by such as might be
convinced that it is of divine Revelation, but with a necessity of its
being explicitely believed by all</i><a
name="R_27" id="R_27" href="#N_27" class="nanchor">[27]</a>. Now,
no such unanimous consent can be pretended for the forementioned
<i>Consubstantiality</i>. For, not to speak of the times next following the
Council of <i>Nice</i>, nor yet of several expressions in the Ancients,
<i>Justin Martyr</i>, <i>Irenæus</i>, <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>,
<i>Origen</i>, that seem to favour our opinion<a
name="R_28" id="R_28" href="#N_28" class="nanchor">[28]</a>: Nor,
of those Eastern Bishops, which <i>Arrius</i>, in his Letter to <i>Eusebius
Nicomed.</i><a
name="R_29" id="R_29" href="#N_29" class="nanchor">[29]</a>
(numbers on his side,) <i>Hilarius</i><a
name="R_30" id="R_30" href="#N_30" class="nanchor">[30]</a>
relates no less than Eighty Bishops before that Council, to have
disallowed the reception of the word <span
title="homousios">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>;
and in the Council also Seventeen, (some of note) at first to have
dissented from the rest.</p>

<h3><a name="S_14" id="S_14">§. 14.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Not yeilding what you say for truth; but for the
present, supposing it; yet the Judgment of so <i>small</i> a
<i>party</i> may by no means be adhered to by you, it being
inconsiderable in respect of the <i>whole Body</i> of the Catholick
Church declaring against you.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> If the consent of the much major part is to be taken
for the whole, then the Reformed cannot maintain their dissent from
the much more numerous body of Christianity, that opposed their
opinions, and sense of Scriptures at the beginning of the Reformation,
and do still oppose them. But not to stand upon this, I would
willingly conform to the unanimous, or most general judgment of the
Church Catholick; if I were secure that she could not be mistaken in
it. But <a name="R_31" id="R_31" href="#N_31" class="nanchor">[31]</a><i>The
sense of the Church Catholick is no infallible rule of
interpreting Scripture in all things which concern the Rule of
Faith</i>&mdash;<a name="R_32" id="R_32" href="#N_32"
class="nanchor">[32]</a><i>Nor may she usurp that royal Prerogative
of Heaven, in prescribing infallibly in matters questioned.</i></p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> You may be secure, that she never erreth in any point
<i>necessary</i>.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> But you tell me, that though she never err in
necessaries, yet it follows not, that she is an <i>unerring Guide or
Witness</i> therein<a name="R_33" id="R_33" href="#N_33"
class="nanchor">[33]</a> or, <i>that she must unerringly declare what
points are necessary and what not</i>; and I must first learn, whether
this point of <i>Consubstantiality</i> is to be numbred among
<i>necessaries</i>, before I can be assured, that the sense of the
Church Catholick errs not therein.</p>

<h3><a name="S_15" id="S_15">§. 15.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But <a name="R_34" id="R_34" href="#N_34"
class="nanchor">[34]</a><i>It is a sufficient prescription against
any thing which can be alledged out of Scripture, that it ought not to
be looked on as the true meaning of Scripture, if it appear contrary
to the sense of the Church Catholick from the beginning; and therefore
such doctrines may well be judged destructive to the rule of Faith,
which have been so unanimously condemned by the Church
Catholick.</i></p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Why so?</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> <a name="R_35" id="R_35" href="#N_35"
class="nanchor">[35]</a><i>Because nothing contrary to the necessary
Articles of Faith can be so held by the Catholick Church; for its very
Being depends on its belief of necessaries to salvation.</i></p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> This last is most true; but then, if you mean to make
your discourse cohere, you must say, it is a sufficient prescription,
<i>&amp;c.</i> if it appear contrary to the sense of the Catholick
Church, <i>viz. in a point necessary</i>: for, the reason you give
carries, and secures you no further; and then that which you say is no
great matter: For, here we are still to seek, whether the point we
discourse of is in the affirmative such a <i>necessary</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="S_16" id="S_16">§. 16.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But this is ranked among those points which the Church
hath put in her Creeds.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> From the beginning this Article was not in the Creed;
and though it should be granted that all points necessary are
contained in the Creeds, yet all in the Creeds are not thought points
necessary: <a name="R_36" id="R_36" href="#N_36"
class="nanchor">[36]</a><i>Necessary so, as to be believed by any
before a clear conviction of the divine Revelation thereof</i>: which
conviction I yet want.</p>

<h3><a name="S_17" id="S_17">§. 17.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But yet, though, first the Catholick Church may err in
<i>non-necessaries</i>; And 2ly. in what points are <i>necessary</i>,
what not, her judgment be not infallible, yet you have still great
reason to submit your judgment to hers; because, if it happen to be a
point necessary, she is from the divine Promise infallible and
unerring in it; not so, you. 2. If not necessary, and so both she and
you therein liable to error, yet you much the more; and she also in
these things is appointed by God for your Teacher and Guide.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Therefore I use the help and direction of my spiritual Guides;
consider their reasons; do not rashly depart from their judgment; but
yet <a name="R_37" id="R_37" href="#N_37" class="nanchor">[37]</a><i>The
due submission of my assent, and belief to them is only to be
conditional, with reservation of evidence in God's Word. For in matter
of faith</i> (as Dr. <i>Ferne</i> saith) <i>I cannot submit to any company of
men by resignation of my judgment and belief to receive for faith all
that they shall define, for such resignation stands excluded by the
condition of the authority which is not infallible; and by the
condition of the matter, faith, of high concernment to our own souls,
and to be accounted for by</i> our selves: <i>who therefore stand bound to
make present, and diligent search for that evidence and demonstration
from God's Word, upon which we may finally and securely stay our
belief</i>&mdash;&mdash;And <a
name="R_38" id="R_38" href="#N_38" class="nanchor">[38]</a><i>The Church
determining matter of faith</i> (saith he) <i>ought to manifest it out of</i>
God's Word: <i>and we may expect such Churches, proof, before we yield
absolute assent of belief.</i> And so Dr. <i>Stillingfleet</i> saith<a
name="R_39" id="R_39" href="#N_39" class="nanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>All
men ought to be left to judge according to the Pandects of the divine
Laws, because each member of this Society is bound to take care of his
Soul, and of all things that tend thereto.</i> Now I for my part see no
solid ground out of the Scripture for <i>Consubstantiality</i>, but rather
for the contrary; which several of our Writers have made appear to the
world. And therefore unless the Church were either infallible in all
she determined, or at least in distinguishing those necessaries
wherein she cannot err from the rest, it seems no way justifiable,
that she puts this her definition into the Creed; she, as I conceive,
thus requiring from all an absolute consent thereto; and not only (as some<a
name="R_40" id="R_40" href="#N_40" class="nanchor">[40]</a> would perswade me) a conditional for some of them, <i>viz.</i>
whenever I shall be clearly convinced, that such point is of divine
Revelation.</p>

<div class="summry">

<p class="p1">His Plea, for his not holding any thing contrary to the
Definitions of <i>lawful General Councils</i>, the just conditions
thereof observed.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>That he conceives he ows no obedience to the Council
of</i> Nice.</p>

<ol>
  <li><i>Because this cannot be proved to have been a lawful General
  Council with so much certainty, as is necessary for the ground of
  his Faith, as appears by those many questions mentioned by Mr.</i>
  Chillingworth, Stillingfleet, <i>and other Protestants, wherein he
  must first be satisfied, concerning it.</i></li>

  <li><i>Because, though it were a General Council, yet it might err
  even in necessaries, if it were not universally accepted; as he can
  shew it was not.</i></li>

  <li><i>That, though yielded to be generally accepted, it might err
  still in non-necessaries; and that Protestants cannot prove this
  point to be otherwise.</i></li>

  <li><i>That the Leaders of this Council were plainly a party
  contesting this, for many years before, with the other side
  condemned by them; and were Judges in their own cause.</i></li>

  <li><i>All these exceptions cancelled, and Obedience granted due to
  this Council; yet, that so, there is due to it not that of</i>

  <li><i>But yet that he will submit to the Judgment of a future

<h3><br />§. 18.</h3>

<p class="cap">P<i>Rot.</i> But do you not consider by what persons
this Article was long ago inserted into the Creed: Namely, by the
<i>first General</i>, and the most venerable Assembly of the
<i>Fathers</i> of the Church that hath been convened since the
<i>Apostles</i> times; celebrated under the <i>first Christian</i>
Emperor by a perfect Representative of the Catholick Church; and by
such persons, as came very much purified out of the newly-quenched
fire of the greatest persecution that the Church hath suffered, that
under <i>Dioclesian</i>; will not you then at least submit your
judgment to the Decree of this great and Holy Council; one and the
first of those four which St. <i>Gregory</i> said he received with the
same reverence, as the four Gospels?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> No, And for this I shall give you in brief many reasons, as I
conceive satisfactory. For 1. Had I an obligation of submission of
judgment to lawful General Councils, you cannot prove this such a one,
and those the decrees thereof which are now extant, with such a
certainty as is necessary to build thereon an Article of my Faith. For
to prove this, you must satisfie me in all those things questioned
concerning General Councils * by M. <i>Chillingworth</i>, p. 94. * By Dr.
<i>Pierce</i> in his answer to Mr. <i>Cressy</i>, p. 18. &amp;c. * By Mr.
<i>Whitby</i> from p. 428. to p. 433. [where he concludes: 1. <i>That we
never had a General Council.</i> 2. <i>That a General Council is a thing
impossible</i>.] * By Mr. <i>Stillingfleet</i> p. 508.
&amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;495. 119. 123. &amp;c. Who also, against the
being of such a General Council as is the Representative of the whole
Church Catholick, thus disputes<a
name="R_41" id="R_41" href="#N_41" class="nanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>The
representation of a Church</i> (saith he) <i>by a General Council, is a
thing not so evident, from whence it should come: for if such
representative of the whole Church there be, it must either be so by
some formal act of the Church, or by a tacite consent. It could not be
by any formal act of the Church; for then there must be some such act
of the universal Church preceding the being of any General Council, by
which they receive their Commission to appear in behalf of the
universal Church. Now that the universal Church did ever agree in any
such act is utterly impossible to be demonstrated, either that it
could be, or that it was. But if it be said, that such a formal act is
not necessary, but the tacite consent of the whole Church is
sufficient for it; then such a consent of the Church must be made
evident, by which, they did devolve over the power of the whole Church
to such a</i> Representative. <i>And all these must consent in that act
whose power the Council pretends to have; of which no footsteps
appear&mdash;&mdash;The utmost then</i> (saith he) <i>that can be supposed
in this case, is, that the parts of the Church may voluntarily consent
to accept of the decrees of such a Council; and by that voluntary act,
or by the supreme authority enjoyning it, such decrees may become
obligatory.</i> Thus he. But I suppose its Decrees obligatory then only
to those parts of the Church that voluntarily consent to accept of
them, as the <i>Arians</i> did not to receive the <i>Decrees</i> of <i>Nice</i>.
Lastly, by * Bishop <i>Taylor</i> in the 2d. Part of his <i>Disswasive</i>, <i>l.</i>
1. §. 1. p. 29. <i>&amp;c.</i> to the end of the Section. Where p. 31. he
saith concerning this of <i>Nice</i>, that makes for you, compared with
that of <i>Ariminum</i>, which makes for us&mdash;&mdash;<i>That if a
Catholick producing the Nicene Council be rencountred by an Arian
producing the Council of</i> Ariminium <i>which was far more numerous, here
are</i> aquilis aquilæ &amp; pila minantia pilis: <i>but who shall prevail?
If a General Council be the rule and guide, they will both prevail,
that is, neither. And it ought not to be said by the Catholick; Yea,
but our Council determined for the truth; but yours for error: For,
the</i> Arian <i>will say so too. But, whether they do or no, yet it is
plain that they may both say so: and if they do, then we do not find
the truth out by the conduct and decision of a General Council; but we
approve this General, because upon other accounts we believe that what
is there defined is true. And therefore</i> S. Austin's <i>way here is
best</i>, Neque ego Nicænum Concilium, neque tu Ariminense, <i>&amp;c.
both sides pretend to General Councils: that which both equally
pretend to, will help neither; therefore let us go to Scripture.</i> And
<i>p.</i> 32.&mdash;&mdash;<i>What is the reason</i> (saith he of Councils in
General) <i>that some Councils are partly condemned: the Council of</i>
Sardis, <i>that in</i> Trullo, <i>those of</i> Frankford, Constance, <i>and</i>
Basil? <i>but that every man and every Church accepts the Councils as
far as they please, and no further? The Greeks receive but seven
General Councils, the Lutherans six, the Eutychians three, Nestorians
two</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;Pro captu lectoris habent sua fata. <i>It is
as every one likes.</i> I spare to tell you what he saith, <i>p.</i>
26.&mdash;<i>That in the first General Council of</i> Jerusalem, <i>which was
the first precedent, and ought to be the true measure of the rest, the
Apostles were the Presidents, and the Presbyters Assistants, but the
Church</i> [viz. <i>the converted brethren and the Laity</i>, see p. 36.]
<i>was the Body of the Council, and were Parties in the Decree</i>, quoting
<i>Acts</i> 15, 22, 23. <i>and that we can have no other warrant of an
authentick Council than this.</i> 2. Though it be shewed a lawful General
Council, representing the whole Church (as it ought, if such) yet what
obligation can there lye upon me of consenting to it? since it may
<i>err</i> even in <i>Fundamentals</i>, if it be not universally accepted, as
indeed this Council was not, for several Bishops there were, that were
dissenters in the Council, and many more afterward.<a
name="R_42" id="R_42" href="#N_42" class="nanchor">[42]</a> 3. Were it
universally accepted; yet unless you can shew me by some means, that
this point wherein I differ from its judgment, is a fundamental or
necessary point to salvation, both it, and the Catholick Church also
that accepts it may err therein. 4. The judgment of this Council seems
justly declinable also on this account. That whereas the <i>Guides</i> of
the <i>Church</i>, many years before this Council were divided in their
opinion, <i>Alexander</i> Patriarch of <i>Alexandria</i>, and <i>Hosius</i> a
Favorite of the Emperor heading one party; and <i>Arius</i> and the Bishops
adhering to him, whom I mentioned formerly<a
name="R_43" id="R_43" href="#N_43" class="nanchor">[43]</a>, heading
another, and whereas afterward, in the prosecution of this difference,
both the foresaid <i>Alexander</i> in one <i>Provincial Council</i> held in
<i>Egypt</i>, and <i>Hosius</i> sent thither by the Emperor in another, had
there condemned <i>Arius</i>, and his Confederates; yet so it was ordered,
that in this General Council assembled for an equal hearing and
decision of this Controversie of these two professed Enemies to the
other party, the one (<i>Hosius</i>) was appointed to sit as President of
this Council; and the other (<i>Alexander</i>) held in it the next place to
him; and poor <i>Arius</i> excluded; and the Bishops who favoured him in
the Council, though at first freely declaring their dissent, yet at
last over-awed to a subscription; as also was <i>Arius</i> himself chiefly
by the Emperor <i>Constantine</i>'s overbearing authority; who, before
somewhat indifferent in the contest, yet upon Arius his undutiful and
too peremptory Letters, had some years before taken great offence at
him; and also (as he was very eloquent) publickly written against him<a
name="R_44" id="R_44" href="#N_44" class="nanchor">[44]</a>. Which
<i>overawing</i> hence appears, in that the same <i>Bishops</i> that were
adherents to <i>Arius</i>, when, this Emperor being deceased, <i>Constantius</i>
his Son countenanced their Cause, returned, I say not to their former
Opinion only, but to their publick profession of it. By which we may
guess, that if the Controversie had at that time been committed to
equal and disengaged Judges, and such as had not formerly shewed
themselves a Party; or, if the Oriental Bishops, without any fear of
the Prince upon them, might have given free Votes; and the <i>Arian</i>
Cause had then had a <i>Constantius</i> instead of a <i>Constantine</i>, (things
wherein Protestants well understand me, because on the same Grounds
they have rejected the Council of <i>Trent</i>) we may presume then the
issue would have been under <i>Constantine</i> the same that it was under
his Successor, I say before Judges equal and indifferent, and not such
as were before a Party, though this Party should be compounded of the
chief Superior Prelates of the Church. For, as Dr. <i>Stillingfleet</i> urgeth, <a
name="R_45" id="R_45" href="#N_45" class="nanchor">[45]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>We
must either absolutely, and roundly assert, that it is impossible that
the Superiors in the Church may be guilty of any error or corruption;
or, that if they be, they must never be called to an account for it;
or else, that it may be just, in some Cases, to except against them as
Parties: And if in some Cases, then the Question comes to this,
Whether the present</i> [he speaks of Idolatry, I of Consubstantiality]
<i>be some of these Cases or no? And here if we make those Superiors
Judges again, what we granted before comes to nothing.</i></p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> No Person that is appointed by our Lord to be a Judge in any
Controversie (as those Bishops you have mentioned were in the Cause of
<i>Arius</i>) can rightly or properly be said to be, on that Side for which
he gives Sentence, a Party. Nor doth their giving Sentence once
against any Side, prejudice them (as supposed Enemies, or Opposites,
or Interested) from sitting on the Bench, as oft as need requires, to
pass it again, alone, or with others. But, if every one may be
afterward called an Anti-party, who once declares himself of a
contrary Judgment, I perceive Mr. <i>Chillingworth</i>'s Observation is right, <a
name="R_46" id="R_46" href="#N_46" class="nanchor">[46]</a><i>That, in
Controversies in Religion, it is in a manner impossible to be avoided,
but the Judge must be a Party.</i> I add also, That in Matters of
Religion, where every Man is concerned, and in great Controversies,
especially where is any division of Communion, all, both <i>Laity</i> and
<i>Clergy</i>, speedily own, and range themselves on one side or other;
<i>Clergy</i> interessing themselves for the necessary direction of their
<i>Subjects</i>; <i>Laity</i>, in obedience to their <i>Superiors</i>; neither can
such a Judge be nominated, that is not to one side suspected. So that,
in Controversies of Religion, we must deny any Judge (as he did<a
name="R_47" id="R_47" href="#N_47" class="nanchor">[47]</a>); or this
Plea, That the ordinary Judge, that is assigned us, is a <i>Party</i>, must
not be easily hearkened to. As for that you urge out of Bishop
<i>Taylor</i>, concerning the <i>Laity</i> in the first Council at <i>Jerusalem</i>
(the Pattern to all following) being Parties in the Decree, I suppose
it is meant no further, than that also these may assist in the
Council, and give there a consentient, or attesting, but not a
decisive Vote: which neither did the Emperors claim, when they
presided therein. <i>See Dr. Field of the Church, p.</i> 646.</p>

<h3><a name="S_19" id="S_19">§. 19.</a></h3>

<p><i>Soc.</i> But I have not yet said all. For Fifthly, Were there
none of the forenamed defects in it, <a name="R_48" id="R_48"
href="#N_48" class="nanchor">[48]</a><i>No Authority on Earth can
oblige to</i> internal assent <i>in matters of Faith, or to any
farther Obedience than that of</i> Silence.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Yes, you stand obliged to yield a <i>conditional</i>
assent, at least to the Definitions of these highest Courts, <i>i.
e.</i> unless you can bring evident <i>Scripture</i>, or
<i>Demonstration</i> against them.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> I do not think Protestant Divines agree in this. I find
indeed the Archbishop<a name="R_49" id="R_49" href="#N_49"
class="nanchor">[49]</a> requiring Evidence and Demonstration, for
Inferiors <i>contradicting</i>, or publishing their dissent from the
Councils Decrees, but not requiring thus much for their <i>denial</i>
of <i>assent</i>. And I am told, <a name="R_50" id="R_50" href="#N_50"
class="nanchor">[50]</a>&mdash;<i>That in matters proposed by my
Superiors, as</i> God's Word, <i>and of</i> Faith, <i>I am not tied to
believe it such, till they manifest it to me to be</i> so; <i>and not
that I am to believe it such, unless I can manifest it to be</i>
contrary, <i>because my Faith can rest on no Humane Authority, but
only on God's Word, and Divine Revelation.</i> And Dr. <i>Field</i>
saith,&mdash;<a name="R_51" id="R_51" href="#N_51"
class="nanchor">[51]</a><i>It is not necessary expresly to believe,
whatsoever the Council hath concluded, though it be true, unless by
some other means it appear unto us to be true, and we be convinced of
it in some other sort than by the bare Determination of the
Council.</i> Till I am convinced then of my Error, the Obedience of
<i>Silence</i> is the most that can be required of me.</p>

<h3><a name="S_20" id="S_20">§. 20.</a></h3>

<p>But sixthly, I conceive my self in this point not obliged to this
neither; considering my present persuasion, that this Council
<i>manifestly</i> erred; and that, in an error of such high
consequence (concerning the <i>unity</i> of the <i>most high God</i>)
as is no way to be tolerated; and I want not evident Scriptures, and
many other unanswerable Demonstrations, to shew it did so; and
therefore being admitted into the honourable Function of the Ministry,
I conceive I have a lawful Commission from an <i>higher Authority</i>,
to publish this great Truth of <i>God</i>, and to contradict the
<i>Councils</i> Decree.</p>

<h3>§. 21.</h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But you may easily mistake that for <i>evident Scripture</i>, and
those for <i>Demonstrations</i>, that are not. Concerning which you know
what the Archbishop and Mr. <i>Hooker</i> say<a name="R_52" id="R_52"
href="#N_52" class="nanchor">[52]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>That they are such, as
proposed to any man, and understood, the mind cannot chuse but
inwardly assent to them</i><a name="R_53" id="R_53" href="#N_53"
class="nanchor">[53]</a>. You ought therefore first to propose these to
your Superiors, or to the Church, desiring a redress of such Error by
her calling another Council. And, if these Superiors, acquainted
therewith, dislike your Demonstrations, which the Definition saith, if
they be right ones, they must be by all, and therefore by them,
assented to, methinks, (though this is not said by the Archbishop) in
humility you ought also to suspect these Demonstrations, and remain in
silence at least, and no further trouble the Church.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> May therefore no particular Person, or Church, proceed
to a Reformation of a former Doctrine, if these Superiors, first
complained to, declare the Grounds of such Persons or Churches for it,
not sufficient?</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> I must not say so. But if they neglect (as they may)
to consider their <i>just</i> Reasons so diligently as they ought, and
to call a Council for the Correcting of such Error according to the
weight of these Reasons, then here is place for Inferiors to proceed
to a reformation of such Error without them.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> And who then shall judge, whether the Reasons pretended
are <i>defective</i>, or rather the present Church <i>negligent</i> in
considering them?</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Here, I confess, to make <i>the Superiors</i> Judges
of this, is to cast the Plaintiff before that any Council shall hear
his Grievance, these Superiors, whose Faith appears to adhere to the
former Council, being only Judges in their own Cause; and so the
liberty of complaining will come to nothing<a name="R_54" id="R_54"
href="#N_54" class="nanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> The Inferiors then, that complain, I suppose are to
judge of this. To proceed then. To these Superiors, in many diligent
Writings, we have proposed, as we think, many unanswerable Scriptures,
and Reasons much advanced beyond those represented by our Party to the
former <i>Nicene</i> Council (and therefore from which Evidences of
ours we have just cause to hope from a future Council a contrary
Sentence); and finding no redress by their calling another Council for
a reviewing this Point, we cannot but conceive it as lawful for a
Socinian Church, Pastor, or Bishop, to reform for themselves, and the
Souls committed to them, in an Error appearing to them <i>manifest</i>
and <i>intolerable</i>, as for the Protestants, or for Dr.
<i>Luther</i>, to have done the same for Transubstantiation, Sacrifice
of the Mass, and other Points that have been concluded, against the
Truth, by several former Councils.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But such were not <i>lawful General Councils</i>, as
that of <i>Nice</i> was.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Whatever these Councils were, this much matters not, as to a
<i>reformation</i> from them; for, had they been lawfully General, yet
Protestants hold<a name="R_55" id="R_55" href="#N_55" class="nanchor">[55]</a>,
these not universally accepted may err even in <i>Fundamentals</i>; or,
when so accepted, yet may err in Non-fundamentals; Errors <i>manifest</i>,
and <i>intolerable</i>, and so may be appealed from to future; and those
not called, their Error presently rectified by such Parts of
Christianity as discern it; and also S. <i>Austin</i><a name="R_56"
id="R_56" href="#N_56" class="nanchor">[56]</a> is frequently quoted by
them, saying&mdash;&mdash;<i>That past General Councils erring, may be
corrected by other Councils following</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="S_22" id="S_22">§. 22.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But I pray you consider, if that famous Council of
<i>Nice</i> hath so erred, another Council called, may it also not
err, notwithstanding your Evidences proposed to it? For, though
perhaps some new demonstrative Proofs you may pretend from several
Texts more accurately compared and explained; yet you will not deny
this sufficient Evidence to have been extant for that most Learned
Council to have seen the Truth, having then the same entire Rule of
Faith as you now, the Scriptures, (in which, you say, your clearest
Evidences lie) for their direction. When a Future Council (then) is
assembled, and hath heard your Plea, will you <i>assent</i> to it, and
acquiesce in the Judgment thereof?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Yes, interposing the Protestant-Conditions of Assent,
<i>If its Decree be according to God's Word, and we convinced
thereof</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Why, such a submission of Judgment and Assent I
suppose you will presently yield to me in any thing, whereof you are
convinced by me; may this future Council then challenge no further
Duty from you? why then should the Church be troubled to call it?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> <a name="R_57" id="R_57" href="#N_57"
class="nanchor">[57]</a><i>Though this Future Council also should
err, yet it may afford Remedy against Inconveniences; and one great
Inconvenience being, Breaking the Church's Peace; this is remedied by
its Authority</i>, if I only yield the Obedience of Silence
thereto.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But if your Obedience oblige not to <i>silence</i>
concerning Councils past, because of your new Evidences, neither will
it to a future, if you think it also doth err; and either these
Evidences remain still unsatisfied, or these satisfied, yet some other
new ones appear to call for a new Consideration.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> <a name="R_58" id="R_58" href="#N_58" class="nanchor">[58]</a><i>Because
it may also err, it follows not it must err; and it is
probable that it shall not err, when the former Error is thus
discovered, and if the Council proceed lawfully, be not overawed,</i>
&amp;c.<a name="R_59" id="R_59" href="#N_59" class="nanchor">[59]</a>
But however, if I ought upon this review to be restrained to
<i>silence</i>, yet, I not convinced of the truth of its Decree, this
Silence is the uttermost that any future Council, after its rejecting
my Reasons, can justly exact of me; and not <i>belief</i>, or <i>assent</i>, at
all: It may not oblige me, that I should relinquish that you call
<i>Socinianism</i> at all, but that, not divulge it; whereas now by the
Acts of <i>former</i> Councils (I would gladly know upon what rational
ground) an <i>Anathema</i> is pronounced against me, if I do not believe
the contrary, and I am declared to stand guilty of <i>Heresie</i> meerly
for retaining this Opinion; which retaining it is called <i>obstinacy</i>
and <i>contumacy</i> in me, after the Councils contrary <i>Definition</i>.</p>

<h2>CONFERENCE IV.</h2>

<div class="summry">

<p class="p3">His Plea, for his not being guilty of <i>Heresie</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>That he cannot rightly
according to Protestant Principles, be accused as guilty of</i>
Heresie, <i>for several reasons.</i></p>

<ol>
  <li><i>Because Protestants holding Heresie to be an</i> obstinate
  <i>defence of some error against a fundamental, he thinks from hence
  his tenent freed from being an Heresie, as long as in silence he
  retains it, unless he engage further, to a publick pertinacious
  maintaining thereof.</i> §. <a href="#S_23">23</a>.</li>

  <li><i>Fundamentals varying according to particular persons, and
  sufficient proposal; none can conclude this point in the
  affirmative, to be,</i> as to him, <i>a fundamental, or, of the
  truth of which he hath had a sufficient proposal.</i></li>

  <li><i>That a lawful General Council's declaring some point Heresie,
  doth not necessarily argue that it is so; because they may err in
  Fundamentals; or at least in distinguishing them from other
  points.</i> §. <a href="#S_26">26</a>.</li>

  <li><i>That he can have no autocatacrisie or obstinacy in a
  dissenting from their Definitions, till he is either actually
  convinced, or at least hath had a sufficient proposal either of the
  truth of such point defined: that such Councils have authority to
  require submission, of judgment, and assent to their Definitions: of
  which conviction or sufficient proposal (that varies much, according
  to the differing conditions of several persons) as to himself, none
  can judge save himself: and, consequently, neither can they judge of
  his guilt of Heresie.</i> Ib.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3><br /><a name="S_23" id="S_23">§. 23.</a></h3>

<p class="cap">P<i>Rot.</i> You know that all <i>Hereticks</i> are most
justly <i>anathematized</i>, and cut off from being any longer Members of
the Catholick Church, and so do remain excluded also from Salvation.
Now this <i>Tenent</i> of yours hath always been esteemed by the Church of
God a most pernicious <i>Heresie</i>.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> I confess <i>Heresie</i> a most grievous Crime, dread
and abhor it, and trust I am most free from such a guilt; and from
this I have many ways of clearing my self. For Heresie (as Mr.
<i>Chillingworth</i> defines it) <a name="R_60" id="R_60" href="#N_60"
class="nanchor">[60]</a>being not an erring, but an <i>obstinate</i>
defence of an Error; not of any Error, but of one against a
<i>necessary</i> or <i>fundamental</i> Article of the Christian Faith.
First, Though this which I hold should be an error, and that against a
Fundamental, yet my silence practised therein, can never be called an
obstinate defence thereof, and therefore not my tenent an
<i>Heresie</i>. 2. Since Fundamentals vary according to particular
persons, and (as Mr. <i>Chillingworth</i> saith<a name="R_61"
id="R_61" href="#N_61" class="nanchor">[61]</a>)&mdash;<i>No Catalogue
thereof, that can be given, can universally serve for all men; God
requiring more of them, to whom he gives more, and less of them, to
whom he gives less;&mdash;And that may be sufficiently declared to one
(all things considered) which (all things considered) is not to
another sufficiently declared: and variety of circumstances makes it
as impossible to set down an exact Catalogue of Fundamentals, as to
make a Coat to fit the Moon in all her changes</i>: And (as Mr.
<i>Stillingfleet</i> follows him<a name="R_62" id="R_62" href="#N_62"
class="nanchor">[62]</a>) <i>since the measure of Fundamentals depends
on the sufficiency of the proposition; and none can assign what number
of things are sufficiently propounded to the belief of all persons, or
set down the exact bounds, as to all individuals, when their ignorance
is inexcusable, and when not; or tell what is the measure of their
capacity; what allowance God makes for the prejudice of Education</i>,
&amp;c. Hence I conceive my self free from Heresie, in this my
opinion, on this score also; because though the contrary be to some
others a Fundamental truth, and to be explicitly believed by them; yet
to me, as not having any sufficient proposal, or conviction thereof,
but rather of the contrary, it is no <i>Fundamental</i>, and
consequently, my tenent opposing it, if an <i>error</i>, yet no
<i>Heresie</i>.</p>

<h3>§. 24.</h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Do not deceive your self; for though according to
different revelations, to those that were without Law, or those under
the Law, or those under the Gospel; <i>Fundamentals</i> generally
spoken of, might be more to some than others; yet to all those who
know and embrace the Gospel, we say<a name="R_63" id="R_63"
href="#N_63" class="nanchor">[63]</a>; all Fundamentals are therein
clearly proposed to all reasonable men, even the unlearned; and
therefore the erring therein, to all such, cannot but be obstinate and
Heretical.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Unless you mean only this, That all Fundamentals, (<i>i.e.</i> so
many as are required of any one) are clear to him in Scripture; but
not all the same Fundamentals, there clear to every one; but to some
more of them; to some fewer; I see not how this last said, accords
with that said before by the same person. But if you mean thus, then
<i>Consubstantiality</i>, (the point we talk of) may be a Fundamental to
you, and clear in Scripture, but also not clear to me in Scripture,
and so no Fundamental, and hence I think my self safe.
For,&mdash;&mdash;<a name="R_64" id="R_64" href="#N_64" class="nanchor">[64]</a><i>I
believing all that is clear to me in Scripture, must needs believe
all Fundamentals; and so I cannot incurr Heresie, which is opposite to
some fundamental</i>&mdash;&mdash;<a name="R_65" id="R_65" href="#N_65"
class="nanchor">[65]</a><i>The Scripture sufficiently informing me what is
the Faith, must of necessity also teach me what is Heresie: That which
is streight will plainly teach us what is crooked; and one contrary
cannot but manifest the other.</i></p>

<h3>§. 25.</h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> I pray you consider a little better what you said last; for
since Heresie as you grant it, is an obstinate defence of error only
against some <i>necessary</i> point of Faith; and all truth delivered in
Scripture is not such; unless you can also distinguish, in Scripture,
these points of necessary Faith from others, you can have no certain
knowledge of Heresie, and the believing all that is delivered in
Scripture, though it may preserve you from <i>incurring</i> Heresie, yet
cannot direct you at all for <i>knowing</i> or <i>discerning</i> Heresie, or an
error against a fundamental or a necessary point of Faith, from other
simple and less dangerous errors, that are not so: nor, by this can
you ever know what errors are Heresies, what not; and so after all
your confidence, if by your neglect you happen not to believe some
Scriptures in their true sense, you can have no security in your
Fundamental, or necessary Faith; or of your not incurring <i>Heresie</i>.
Neither, Secondly, according to your discourse, hath the Church any
means to know any one to be an <i>Heretick</i>; because she can never know
the just latitude of his fundamentals. And so <i>Heresie</i> will be a
grievous sin indeed; but walking under such a vizard of non-sufficient
proposal, as the Ecclesiastical Superiors cannot discover or punish
it. Therefore to avoid such confusion in the Christian Faith, there
hath been alwaies acknowledged in the Church some authority for
declaring Heresie; and it may seem conviction enough to you, that her
<i>most General Councils</i> have defined the contrary position to what you
maintain; and received it for a <i>fundamental</i>. Of which Ecclesiastical
Authority for declaring Heresie, thus Dr. <i>Potter</i>, <a name="R_66"
id="R_66" href="#N_66" class="nanchor">[66]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>The
Catholick Church is careful to ground all her declarations in matters
of Faith, upon the divine authority of Gods written word. And
therefore whosoever wilfully opposeth a judgment so well grounded, is
justly esteemed an Heretick; not properly because he disobeys the
Church; but because he yields not to Scripture sufficiently
propounded, or cleared unto him</i> [i. e. by the Church.] Where the
Doctor seems to grant these two things: That all that the Catholick
Church declares against Heresie is grounded upon the Scripture; and
that all such as oppose her judgment are Hereticks: but only he adds,
that they are not Hereticks properly, or formally for this opposing
the Church, but for opposing the Scriptures. Whilst therefore the
<i>formalis ratio</i> of Heresie is disputed, that all such are Hereticks
seems granted. And the same Dr. elsewhere concludes thus, <a
name="R_67" id="R_67" href="#N_67" class="nanchor">[67]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>The
mistaker will never prove, that we oppose any Declaration of the
Catholick Church</i>, [he means such a Church as makes Declarations, and
that must be in her Councils]&mdash;&mdash;<i>And therefore he doth
unjustly charge us with Heresie.</i> And again, he saith, <a name="R_68"
id="R_68" href="#N_68" class="nanchor">[68]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Whatsoever
opinion these ancient writers</i> [S. Austin, Epiphanius and others]
<i>conceived to be contrary to the common or approved opinion of
Christians, that they called an Heresie, because it differed from the
received opinion; not because it opposed any formal Definition of the
Church</i>: where, in saying, <i>not because it opposed any Definition</i>, he
means, <i>not only because</i>. For, whilst that, which differed from the
received opinion of the Church, was accounted an Heresie by them,
that, which differed from a formal definition of the Church, was so
much more. Something I find also for your better information, in the
Learned Dr. <i>Hammond</i>, <a name="R_69" id="R_69" href="#N_69"
class="nanchor">[69]</a>commenting on that notable Text in
<i>Titus</i>&mdash;&mdash;<i>A man that is an Heretick after the first and
second admonition, reject</i>, [a Text implying contrary to your
discourse, Heresie discoverable, and censurable by the Church,] where
he explains <span
title="autokatakritos">&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8049;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>
<i>self-condemned; not to signifie a mans publick accusing
or condemning his own doctrines or practices; for that condemnation
would rather be a motive to free one from the Church's Censures. Nor
2ly to denote one that offends against Conscience, and though he knows
he be in the wrong, yet holds out in opposition to the Church; for so,
none but Hypocrites would be Hereticks; and he that stood against the
Doctrin of Christ and his Church in the purest times</i> [you may guess
whom he means] <i>should not be an Heretick: and so no Heretick could
possibly be admonished or censured by the Church, for no man would acknowledge
of himself, that what he did was by him done against his
own Conscience</i>, [the plea which you also make here for your
self.] <i>But to be an expression of his separation from, and disobedience
to the Church; and so an evidence of the</i> <span title="exestraptai kai
hamartanei">&#949;&#958;&#8051;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#953;
&#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8049;&#957;&#949;&#953;</span>
<i>his being perverted, and sinning wilfully, and without excuse.</i> What say
you to this?</p>

<h3><a name="S_26" id="S_26">§. 26.</a></h3>

<p><i>Soc.</i> What these Authors say, as you give their sense, seems to me
contrary to the <i>Protestant</i> Principles, [<i>See D.</i> Potter, <i>p.</i> 165,
167.&mdash;&mdash;<i>D.</i> Hammond <i>of Heresie</i>, §. 7.
<i>n.</i>&mdash;&mdash;§. 9. <i>n.</i> 8. <i>Def. of L. Falkl. c.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 23.]
and to their own positions elsewhere; neither, surely, will
<i>Protestants</i> tye themselves to this measure and trial of
<i>autocatacrisie</i>. For, since they say; That lawful General Councils
may err in Fundamentals; these Councils may also define, or declare
something <i>Heresie</i> that is not against a Fundamental; and if so, I,
though in this self-convinced, that such is their Definition, yet am
most free from Heresie in my not assenting to it, or (if they err
intollerably) in opposing it. Again, since Protestants say, Councils
may err in distinguishing Fundamentals, these Councils may err also in
discerning Heresie, which is an error against a Fundamental, from
other errors that are against non-Fundamentals. Again: Whilst I cannot
distinguish Fundamentals in their Definitions, thus no Definition of a
General Council may be receded from by me, for fear of my incurring
Heresie; a consequence which Protestants allow not. Again: Since
Protestants affirm all Fundamentals plain in Scripture, why should
they place <i>autocatacrisie</i>, or self-conviction, in respect of the
Declaration of the Church rather than of the Scripture? But, to
requite your former quotations, I will shew in plainer Language the
stating of Protestant Divines concerning Autocatacrisie as to the
Definitions of the Church, under which my opinion also finds
sufficient shelter; <i>We have no assurance at all</i> (saith Bishop
<i>Bramhall</i><a
name="R_70" id="R_70" href="#N_70" class="nanchor">[70]</a>) <i>that all
General Councils were, and always shall be so prudently managed, and
their proceedings always so orderly and upright, that we dare make all
their sentences a sufficient conviction of all Christians, which they
are bound to believe under pain of damnation.</i> [I add, or under pain
of Heresie]&mdash;And <i>Ib.</i> p. 102.&mdash;&mdash;<i>I acknowledge</i>
(saith he) <i>that a General Council, may make that revealed truth
necessary to be believed by a Christian as a point of Faith, which
formerly was not necessary to be believed; that is, whensoever the
reasons and grounds of truth produced by the Council, or the authority
of the Council (which is, and always ought to be very great with all
sober discreet Christians) do convince a man in his Conscience of the
truth of the Councils Definitions</i>: which truth I am as yet not
convinced of, neither from the reasons nor authority of the Council
of <i>Nice</i>. Or, if you had rather have it out of Dr.
<i>Potter</i>&mdash;&mdash;<i>It is not resisting</i> (saith he<a
name="R_71" id="R_71" href="#N_71" class="nanchor">[71]</a>) <i>the voice or
definitive sentence, which makes an Heretick; but an obstinate
standing out against evident Scripture sufficiently cleared unto him.
And the Scripture may then be said to be sufficiently cleared when it
is so opened, that a good and teachable mind</i> (<i>loving and seeking
truth</i>) [my Conscience convinceth me not, but that such I am] <i>cannot
gainsay it.</i>&mdash;Again <a name="R_72" id="R_72" href="#N_72"
class="nanchor">[72]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>It is possible</i> (saith he) <i>that
the sentence of a Council or Church may be erroneous, either because
the opinion condemned is no Heresie or error against the Faith, in it
self considered; or because the party so condemned is not sufficiently
convinced in his understanding (not clouded with prejudice, ambition,
vain-glory, or the like passion) that it is an error</i> [one of these I
account my self.] Or out of Dr. <i>Hammond</i>, <a name="R_73" id="R_73" href="#N_73"
class="nanchor">[73]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>It must be lawful for the Church of
God</i>, [any Church, or any Christian, upon the Doctors reason,] <i>as
well as for the Bishop of</i> Rome, <i>to enquire whether the Decrees of an
Universal Council have been agreeable to Apostolical Tradition or no;
and if they be found otherwise, to eject them out, or not to receive
them into their</i> belief. <i>And then still it is the matter of the
Decrees, and the Apostolicalness of them, and the force of the
testification, whereby they are approved and acknowledged to be such,
which gives the authority to the Council; and nothing else is
sufficient, where that is not to be found.</i> And elsewhere he both
denies in General an Infallibility of Councils, and grounds the
Reverence due to the Four first Councils <i>on their setting down and
convincing the truth of their Doctrin out of the Scripture words
understood with piety,&mdash;&mdash;and the fetching their Definitions
regularly from the sense thereof, which the General Churches had
received down from the Apostles</i>.<a
name="R_74" id="R_74" href="#N_74" class="nanchor">[74]</a> [Upon which
follows, that, in such case, where a Lawful General Council doth not
so, (as possibly it may, and Inferiors are to consider for themselves,
whether it doth not) there may be no Heretical Autocatacrisie in a
dissent from it, nor this dissent <i>an evidence of the</i> <span
title="exestraptai">&#949;&#958;&#8051;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>
<i>and</i> <span
title="hamartanei">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#8049;&#957;&#949;&#953;</span>
<i>his being perverted and sinning wilfully, and without
excuse.</i>]&mdash;&mdash;Lastly, thus Doctor <i>Stillingfleet</i> concerning
<i>Heresie</i><a
name="R_75" id="R_75" href="#N_75" class="nanchor">[75]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>The
formal reason of Heresie is denying something supposed to be of divine
Revelation; and therefore,</i> 2ly. <i>None can reasonably be accused of
Heresie, but such as have sufficient reason to believe, that that
which they deny is revealed by God. And therefore,</i> 3ly. <i>None can be
guilty of Heresie for denying any thing declared by the Church; unless
they have sufficient reason to believe, that whatever is declared by
the Church is revealed by God; and therefore the Church's Definition
cannot make any</i> Hereticks, <i>but such as have reason to believe, that
she cannot err in her Definitions.</i> From hence also he gathers, <i>That
Protestants are in less danger of Heresie than Papists, till these
give them more sufficient reasons to prove, that whatever the Church
declares, is certainly revealed by God</i>. Thus he. Now such sufficient
proving reasons as Protestants plead, that Papists have not yet given
them concerning this matter of Church-Authority, I alledge, that
neither have they nor others given me. To be <i>self-condemned</i>,
therefore, in my dissent from the definition of the Council of <i>Nice</i>,
I must first have sufficient reason proposed to me to believe, (and so
remain self-condemned and Heretical in disbelieving it) this point;
<i>viz.</i> That the Church, or her Council, hath power to define matters
of Faith in such manner, as to require my assent thereto. Which so
long as I find no sufficient reason to believe, I suppose I am freed
(without obstinacy or Heresie, or being therein self-condemned,) from
yielding assent to any particular matter of Faith, which the Church
defines. And, had I sufficient reason proposed to me for believing
this point, yet so long as I am not actually convinced thereof, I
become only guilty of a fault of <i>ignorance</i>, not <i>obstinacy</i>, or
<i>autocatacrisie</i>, or <i>Heresie</i>; for, if I am self-condemned, or guilty
of obstinacy in disbelieving the foresaid points, <a
name="R_76" id="R_76" href="#N_76" class="nanchor">[76]</a><i>Then I become
so, either by the Church's definition of this point, or without it. By
reason of the Church's definition of this it cannot be; for this very
power of defining is the thing in question, and therefore cannot be
cleared to me by the Church's defining it</i><a
name="R_77" id="R_77" href="#N_77" class="nanchor">[77]</a>: and thus,
<i>That thing is proposed to me in the definition to be believed, which
must be supposed to be believed by me already, before such proposal or
definition, or else the definition is not necessary to be believed</i>. <a
name="R_78" id="R_78" href="#N_78" class="nanchor">[78]</a>Nor <i>without</i>,
or <i>before</i> such definition, can I have an <i>autocatacrisie</i>; because
this autocatacrisie, you say with Dr. <i>Hammond</i>, ariseth from my
disobedience to the Church.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Methinks, you make the same plea for your self in this matter,
as if one, that is questioned for not obeying the <i>divine precepts</i>,
or not believing the divine Revelations delivered in <i>Scripture</i>,
should think to excuse himself by this answer; that indeed he doth not
believe the <i>Scripture</i> to be <i>God's Word</i>; and therefore he
conceives, that he cannot reasonably be required to believe that which
is contained therein. And, as such a person hath as much reason
(though this, not from the Scripture, yet from Apostolical Tradition)
to believe that Scripture is Gods Word, as to believe what is written
in it; so have you, though not from the <i>Nicene</i> Council defining it,
yet from Scripture and Tradition manifesting it, as much reason to
believe its authority of defining, as what is defined. It's true
indeed; that had you not sufficient proposal, or sufficient reason to
know this your duty of <i>Assent</i> to this definition of the Council of
<i>Nice</i>, you were faultless in it; but herein lies your danger, that
from finding a <i>non actual conviction</i> of the truth, within, (hindred
there by I know not what supine negligence, or strong self-conceit,
<i>&amp;c.</i>) you gather a <i>non-sufficient proposal</i>, without.</p>

<h3>§ 27.</h3>

<p><i>Soc.</i> It remains then to enquire, who shall judge concerning
this <i>sufficient proposal</i>, or sufficient reason, which I am said
to have, to believe what the <i>Nicene</i> Council, or the Church hath
declared in this point. <a name="R_79" id="R_79" href="#N_79"
class="nanchor">[79]</a>Whether the Church's judgment is to be taken
by me in this, or my own made use of; If <i>her judgment</i>, the
ground of my belief and of Heresie lies still in the Church's
<i>definition</i>; and thus it will be all one in effect, whether I
believe what she declares, without sufficient reason; or learn this of
her, when there is sufficient reason to believe so. It must be then,
<i>my own judgment</i>, I am to be directed by in this matter<a
name="R_80" id="R_80" href="#N_80" class="nanchor">[80]</a>: and if
so, then it is to be presumed, that God doth both afford me some means
not to be mistaken therein; and also some certain knowledge when I do
use this means aright: (for, without these two I can have no security
in my own judgment in a matter of so high concernment, as
<i>Heresie</i> and <i>fundamental Faith</i> is.) Now this means, in
this matter, I presume I have daily used, in that I find my
Conscience, after much examination, therein to acquit me, unless you
can prescribe me some other surer evidence, without sending me back
again to the <i>authority</i> of the <i>Church</i>.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> 1. Whilst your discovery of your tenent to be an
<i>Heresie</i> depends on your having sufficient reason to believe it
is so. And 2. The judgment of your having, or not having sufficient
reason to believe this, is left to your self, the Church hath no means
to know you or any other to be an Heretick, till they declare
themselves to be so. And thus, in striving to free your self from
Heresie, you have freed all mankind from it, (as to any external
discovery and convincement thereof) and cancelled such a sin; unless
we can find one, that will confess himself to maintain a thing against
his own Conscience.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> If I, so do the Protestants; for, they also hold none
guilty of <i>Heresie</i>, for denying any thing declared by the
Church, unless they have reason to believe, that whatever is declared
by the Church is revealed by God; and of this sufficient reason they
make not the <i>Church</i> or <i>Superiors</i>, but <i>themselves</i>,
the Judge.</p>

<h2>CONFERENCE V.</h2>

<div class="summry">

<p class="p3">His Plea, for his not being guilty of <i>Schism</i>.</p>

<ol>
  <li><i>That the Socinian Churches have not forsaken the whole Church
  Catholick, or the external Communion of it: but only left one part
  of it that was corrupted; and reformed another part,</i> (i.e.)
  <i>themselves. Or, that he, and the Socinian Churches, being a part
  of the Catholick, they have not separated from the whole, because
  not from themselves.</i> §. <a href="#S_28">28</a>.</li>

  <li><i>That their separation being for an error unjustly imposed
  upon them as a condition of Communion, the Schism is not theirs, who
  made the separation; but theirs who caused it.</i> §. <a href="#S_29">29</a>.
  <br />
  <i>Besides that, whatever the truth of things be; yet so long as
  they are required by any Church to profess they believe, what they
  do not, their separation cannot be said causless, and so Schism.</i>
  §. <a href="#S_32">32</a>.</li>

  <li><i>That though he and his party had forsaken the external
  Communion of all other Churches, yet not the internal; in which they
  remain still united to them: both in that internal Communion of</i>
  Charity, <i>in not condemning all other Churches as non-Catholick;
  and in that of</i> Faith, <i>in all Essentials and Fundamentals, and
  in all such points, wherein the Unity of the Church Catholick
  consists.</i> §. <a href="#S_30">30</a>.</li>

  <li><i>That the doctrin of</i> Consubstantiality <i>for which they
  departed, is denyed by them to be any Fundamental; nor can the
  Churches, from which they depart for it, be a competent Judge
  against them, that it is so.</i> §. <a href="#S_34">34</a>.</li>

  <li><i>That, though they are separaters from the Roman, yet not from the
  Reformed Churches, which Churches leave men to the liberty of their
  own judgment; nor require any internal assent to their doctrins (in
  which thing these blame the tyranny of the Roman</i> Church) <i>save only
  conditional, if any be convinced of the truth thereof; or, not
  convinced of the contrary.</i> §. <a href="#S_35">35</a>.</li>

  <li><i>In fine, that for enjoying and continuing in the
  Protestant</i> Communion <i>he maketh as full a profession of
  conformity to her Doctrins as</i> Mr. Chillingworth <i>hath done in
  several places of his book, which yet was accepted as
  sufficient.</i> §. <a href="#S_41">41</a>.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3><br /><a name="S_28" id="S_28">§. 28.</a></h3>

<p class="cap">P<i>Rot.</i> I have yet one thing more, about which to
question you. If you will not acknowledge your opinion <i>Heresie</i>
in opposing the publick judgment, and definition of the Catholick
Church in that most reverend Council of <i>Nice</i>, upon pretence
that you have not had a convincing Proposal, that this Definition was
therein made according to <i>God's Word</i>, or the <i>Scriptures</i>;
yet, how will you clear your self, or your Socinian Congregations of
<i>Schism</i>? avoidable upon no plea of adherence to Scripture, if it
shall appear, that you have for this opinion deserted the Communion of
the <i>Catholick Church</i>; out of which Church is no Salvation.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> <a name="R_81" id="R_81" href="#N_81"
class="nanchor">[81]</a><i>I grant there neither is, nor can be any
just cause to depart from the Church of</i> Christ; <i>no more than
from</i> Christ <i>himself: therefore I utterly deny, that our
Churches have made any separation from the</i> Church Catholick <i>at
all: and this for many reasons. For</i> 1st. <a name="R_82" id="R_82"
href="#N_82" class="nanchor">[82]</a>&mdash;<i>We have not forsaken
the whole Church, or the external Communion of it: but only that</i>
part <i>of it which is corrupted, and still will be so; and have not
forsaken, but only reformed another</i> part <i>of it, which part</i>
we our selves <i>are: and I suppose you will not go about to perswade
us, that we have forsaken</i> our selves, <i>or our own Communion. And
if you urge, that we joined our selves to no other part, therefore we
separated from the whole: I say, it follows not, inasmuch as</i> our
selves <i>were a part of it, and still continued so, and therefore can
no more separate from the whole, than from our selves.</i></p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> So then, it seems we need fear no <i>Schism</i>, from
the <i>Church Catholick</i> till a part can divide from it self, which
can never be.</p>

<h3><a name="S_29" id="S_29">§. 29.</a></h3>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Next, As for our separating from all other particular Churches,
the ground of our Separation being an error, which hath crept into the
Communion of these Churches, and which is unjustly imposed upon us in
order to this Communion, we conceive, in this case, if any, <i>They, not
We</i>, are the <i>Schismaticks</i>: for as the Arch-Bishop<a name="R_83"
id="R_83" href="#N_83" class="nanchor">[83]</a>.&mdash;&mdash;<i>The Schism
is theirs, whose the Cause of it is; and he makes the separation, who
gives the first just cause of it, not he that makes actual
separation, upon a just cause preceding.</i></p>

<h3><a name="S_30" id="S_30">§. 30.</a></h3>

<p>Again, Though we have made an actual Separation from them, as to
the not-conforming to, or also as to the reforming of an error: yet,
First, <i>As to Charity</i>; we do still retain with the same Churches
our former Communion.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Not dividing from them through
the breach of Charity; Or condemning all other Churches, as no parts
of the Catholick Church, and drawing the Communion wholly to our
selves, as did those famous Schismaticks, the Donatists.</i> [See
Doctor <i>Ferne Division of Churches</i>, p. 105. and 31, 32.]</p>

<h3>§. 31.</h3>

<p>Next, <i>as to matter of Faith</i>: We hold that all separation
from all particular Churches in such a thing, wherein the <i>unity</i>
of the Catholick Church doth not consist, is no separation from the
whole Church, nor is any thing more, than our suspension from the
Communion of particular Churches, till such their error is reformed;
For, as Doctor <i>Stillingfleet</i><a name="R_84" id="R_84"
href="#N_84" class="nanchor">[84]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>There can be no
separation from the whole Church, but in such things, wherein the
unity of the whole Church lies:&mdash;Whoso therefore separates from
any particular Church as to things not concerning their being, is only
separated from the Communion of that Church, and not the
Catholick.</i> Now, that for which we have separated from other
Churches, we conceive not such, as is essential, or concerns the being
of a Church so, that without it we or they cannot still retain the
essence thereof; we declare also our readiness to joyn with them
again, if this error be corrected, or at least not imposed: And <a
name="R_85" id="R_85" href="#N_85" class="nanchor">[85]</a>(as Dr.
<i>Stillingfleet</i> saith)&mdash;&mdash;<i>Where there is this
readiness of Communion, there is no absolute separation from the
Church as such, but only suspending Communion, till such abuses be
reformed</i>, [or not pressed upon us]. And as Bishop Bramhall<a
name="R_86" id="R_86" href="#N_86"
class="nanchor">[86]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>When one part of the
universal Church separateth it self from another part, not absolutely
or in essentials, but respectively in abuses, and innovations, not as
it is a part of the universal Church, but only so far as it is
corrupted and degenerated</i> [whether in doctrin or manners] <i>it
doth still retain a Communion not only with the Catholick Church, and
with all the Orthodox members of the Catholick Church, but even with
that corrupted Church, from which it is separated, except only in such
Corruptions.</i></p>

<h3><a name="S_32" id="S_32">§. 32.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Saving better Judgments, methinks a separation (if causeless)
from the Communion of all other Churches, or from those who are our
Superiors, in a lesser matter than such a Fundamental or essential
point of Christianity as destroys the being of a Church, should be
<i>Schism</i>; and the smaller the point for which we separate, the greater
the guilt of our separation. Were not the Donatists Schismaticks in
rejecting the Catholick Communion, requiring their conformity in such
a point, in which St. <i>Cyprian</i>'s error before the Church's defining
thereof was very excusable; and the African Congregations in his time
not un-churched thereby?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> <a name="R_87" id="R_87" href="#N_87"
class="nanchor">[87]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>But the Donatists did cut off
from the Body of Christ, and the hope of Salvation, the Church from
which they separated, which is the property of
Schismaticks.</i>&mdash;&mdash;And <a name="R_88" id="R_88"
href="#N_88" class="nanchor">[88]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>They were justly
charged with Schism, because they confined the Catholick Church within
their own bounds.</i> But as Dr. <i>Ferne</i> saith<a name="R_89"
id="R_89" href="#N_89" class="nanchor">[89]</a>&mdash;<i>Had the
Donatists only used their liberty and judgment in that practice of
re-baptizing Hereticks, leaving other Churches to their liberty; and
(though thinking them in an error for admitting Hereticks, without
baptizing them, yet) willing to have Communion with them, as parts of
the Catholick Church (saving the practices wherein they differed),
then had they not been guilty of Schism.</i> In that which I hold I
only follow my Conscience, condemn not the Churches holding otherwise:
On the other side <a name="R_90" id="R_90" href="#N_90"
class="nanchor">[90]</a><i>Christ hath forbid me under pain of
damnation to profess what I believe not</i> [be it small or great]
<i>and consequently under the same penalty hath obliged me to leave
the Communion, in which I cannot remain without the Hypocritical
Profession of such a thing, which I am convinced to be erroneous.</i>
<a name="R_91" id="R_91" href="#N_91" class="nanchor">[91]</a><i>At
least this I know, that the Doctrin which I have chosen, to me</i>
seems <i>true, and the contrary, which I have forsaken,</i> seems
<i>false: and therefore, without remorse of Conscience, I may profess
that, but this I cannot: and a separation, for preserving my
Conscience, I hope will never be judged causeless.</i></p>

<h3>§. 33.</h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> At this rate none will be a Schismatick, but he who
knows he erreth (<i>i. e.</i> not who holdeth, but only who professeth
an error); or who knows, that the point, for the non-conformity to
which, required of him, he deserts the Church, is a <i>Truth</i>, and
the contrary, which he maintains, an error. But Doctor
<i>Hammond</i><a name="R_92" id="R_92" href="#N_92"
class="nanchor">[92]</a> tells you. <i>That he that doth not
communicate with those</i> [I suppose he means Superiors] <i>the
condition of whose Communion contains nothing really erroneous or
sinful, though the doctrin so proposed as the condition of their
Communion, be apprehended by him, to whom it is thus proposed, to be
false, remains in Schism.</i></p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> And at this rate, all those, who separate from the
Church, requiring their assent to what is indeed a truth, will be
Schismaticks, (and that, whether in a point Fundamental, or not
Fundamental,) though they have used all the industry, all the means
they can (except this, the relying on their Superiors judgment) not to
err; unless you will say, that all truths, even not Fundamental, are
in Scripture so clear, that none using a right industry, can (neither)
err in them; which no <i>Chillingworth</i> hath maintained
hitherto.</p>

<h3><a name="S_34" id="S_34">§. 34.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> But we may let this pass; for, your separation was in
a point perspicuous enough in Scripture (and so you void of such
excuse): was in a point Essential and Fundamental, and in which a
wrong belief destroys any longer Communion of a particular Person or
Church, with the Catholick.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> This I utterly deny; nor see I by what way this can ever be
proved against me, for you can assign no Ecclesiastical Judge that can
distinguish Fundamentals, Necessaries, or Essentials, from those
points that are not so, as hath been shewed already. And as Dr.
<i>Stillingfleet</i><a name="R_93" id="R_93" href="#N_93" class="nanchor">[93]</a>
urgeth concerning Heresie, so may I concerning Schism:&mdash;&mdash;What
are the measures whereby we ought to judge, what things are Essential
to the being of Christianity, or of the Church? Whether must the
<i>Church's judgment</i> be taken, or every <i>mans own judgment</i>? if the
<i>former</i>, the Ground of Schism lies still in the Church's definitions,
contrary to what Protestants affirm: if <i>the latter</i>; then no one can
be a Schismatick, but he, that opposeth that of which <i>he is</i>, or <i>may
be convinced</i>, that it is a Fundamental, or essential matter of Faith.
If he be only a Schismatick, that opposeth that, of which <i>he is
convinced</i>; then no man is a Schismatick, but he that goes against his
present Judgment; and so there will be few Schismaticks in the world;
If he, that opposeth that, which <i>he may be convinced</i> of; then again,
it is that which <i>he may be convinced</i> of, either in the Church's
judgment or in his own: If in the Church's, it comes to the same
issue, as in the former: If <i>in his own</i>; how I pray, shall I know,
that I may be convinced of what, using a due indeavour, I am not
convinced already? or, how shall I know, when a due industry is used?
and if I cannot know this, how should I ever settle my self unless it
be upon <i>Authority</i>, which you allow not. Again, I am taught, that any
particular, whether Person or Church, may judge for themselves with
the <i>Judgment</i> of <i>Discretion</i>: And in the matter of Christian
Communion,&mdash;&mdash;<a name="R_94" id="R_94" href="#N_94"
class="nanchor">[94]</a><i>That nothing can be more unreasonable, than that the Society</i>
[suppose it be a Council] <i>imposing conditions of its Communion</i>
[suppose the Council of <i>Nice</i> imposing Consubstantiality so] <i>should
be Judge, whether those conditions be just and equitable or no: And
especially in this case, where a considerable Body of Christians judge
such things required to be unlawful conditions of Communion, what
justice or reason is there, that the party accused should sit judge in
his own cause?</i></p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> By this way no <i>Separatist</i> can ever be a
<i>Schismatick</i>, if he is constituted the judge, whether the reason
of his separation is just.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> And in the other way, there can never be any just cause
of separation at all, if the Church-Governors, from whom I separate,
are to judge, whether that be an error, for which I separate.</p>

<h3><a name="S_35" id="S_35">§. 35.</a></h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> It seems something that you say: But yet, though upon
such consideration, a free use of your own <i>judgment</i>, as to
providing for your own Salvation is granted you; yet, methinks in this
matter you have some greater cause to suspect it, since several
Churches, having of late taken liberty to examine by Gods Word more
strictly the corrupt doctrins of former ages, yet these
<i>reformed</i>, as well as the other <i>unreformed</i>, stand
opposite to you; and neither those professing to follow the
Scriptures, nor those professing to follow Tradition, and
Church-Authority; neither those requiring strict obedience and
submission of judgment, nor those indulging Christian liberty,
countenance your doctrin. But you stand also <i>Reformers</i> of the
<i>Reformation</i>, and separated from all.</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> Soft a little. Though I stand separated indeed from the present
unreformed Churches; or also (if you will) from the whole Church that
was before <i>Luther</i>; yet I both enjoy the external Communion, and
think I have reason to account my self a true member of the Churches
Reformed; and, as I never condemned them, or thought Salvation not
attainable in them; so neither am I (that I know of) excluded by, or
from them; so long as I retain my opinion in silence, and do not
disturb their peace; and I take my self also on these terms to be a
member, in particular, of the Church of <i>England</i>, wherein I have been
educated. For, all these Churches (as confessing themselves <i>fallible</i>
in their decree) do not require of their Subjects to yield any
<i>internal assent</i> to their Doctrins; or to profess any thing against
their Conscience, and in Hypocrisie; and do forbear to use that
Tyranny upon any for enjoying their Communion, which they so much
condemn in that Church, from which, for this very thing, they were
forced to part Communion, and to reform. Of this matter, thus, Mr.
<i>Whitby</i><a name="R_95" id="R_95" href="#N_95" class="nanchor">[95]</a>&mdash;<i>Whom
did our Convocation ever damn for not internally receiving their
decrees? Do they not leave every man to the liberty of his
judgment?&mdash;They do not require, that we should in all things
believe, as they believe; but that we should submit to their
determination, and not contradict them; their decisions are not
obtruded as infallible Oracles, but only submitted to in order to
peace and unity&mdash;&mdash;So that their work is rather to silence,
than to determine disputes,</i> &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;<i>and</i> p. 438. <i>We
grant a necessity, or at least a convenience of a Tribunal to decide
controversies, but how? Not by causing any person to believe what he
did not antecedently to these decrees, upon the sole authority of the
Council; but by silencing our disputes, and making us acquiesce in
what is propounded without any publick opposition to it, keeping our
opinions to our selves&mdash;&mdash;A liberty of using private
discretion in approving or rejecting any thing as delivered, or not,
in Scripture, we think ought to be allowed; for faith cannot be
compelled; and by taking away this liberty from men, we should force
them to become Hypocrites, and so profess outwardly what inwardly they
disbelieve.</i>&mdash;&mdash;And see Dr. Stillingfleets Rational Account,
p. 104. where, speaking of the obligation to the 39. Articles, he
saith,&mdash;&mdash;<i>That the Church of</i> England, <i>excommunicates such
as openly oppose her doctrin, supposing her fallible; the Roman Church
excommunicates all, who will not believe whatever she defines to be
infallibly true.</i>&mdash;&mdash;<i>That the Church of</i> England <i>bindeth
men to peace to her determinations, reserving to men the liberty of
their judgments, on pain of excommunication if they violate that
peace. For it is plain on the one side, where a Church pretends
infallibility, the excommunication is directed against the persons for
refusing to give internal assent to what she defines: But where a
Church does not pretend to that, the excommunication respects wholly
that overt Act, whereby the Church's peace is broken. And if a Church
be bound to look to her own peace, no doubt she hath power to
excommunicate such as openly violate the bonds of it; which is only an
act of caution in a Church to preserve her self in unity; but where it
is given out, that the Church is infallible, the excommunication must
be so much the more unreasonable, because it is against those internal
acts of the mind, over which the Church as such hath no direct
power.</i>&mdash;&mdash;And p. 55. he quotes these words out of Bishop
<i>Bramhall</i><a name="R_96" id="R_96" href="#N_96" class="nanchor">[96]</a>
to the same sense,&mdash;<i>We do not suffer any man to reject the 39
Articles of the Church of</i> England <i>at his pleasure; yet neither do we
look upon them as essentials of saving faith, or legacies of Christ,
and his Apostles; but, in a mean, as pious opinions fitted for the
preservation of unity; neither do we oblige any man to believe them,
but only not to contradict them. By which we see what vast difference
there is, between those things which are required by the Church of</i>
England <i>in order to peace, and those which are imposed by the Church
of</i> Rome, <i>&amp;c.</i> Lastly, thus Mr. <i>Chillingworth</i><a name="R_97"
id="R_97" href="#N_97" class="nanchor">[97]</a> of the just authority of
Councils and Synods (beyond which the Protestant Synods, or
Convocations pretend not.)&mdash;&mdash;<i>The Fathers of the Church</i>
(saith he) <i>in after times</i> [<i>i. e.</i> after the Apostles] <i>might have
just cause to declare their judgment, touching the sense of some
general Articles of the Creed: but to oblige others to receive their
declarations under pain of damnation, what warrant they had, I know
not: He, that can shew, either that the Church of all ages was to have
this Authority; or, that it continued in the Church for some ages, and
then expired: He, that can shew either of these things let him; for my
part I cannot. Yet I willingly confess the judgment of a Council,
though not infallible, is yet so far directive, and obliging, that</i>
(without apparent reason to the contrary) <i>it may be sin to reject it,
at least not to afford it an outward submission for publick peace
sake.</i> [Thus much, as the Protestant Synods seem contented with, so I
allow]&mdash;Again p. 375. He saith&mdash;&mdash;<i>Any thing besides
Scripture, and the plain, irrefragable, indubitable consequences of
it; Well may Protestants hold it as matter of opinion, but as matter
of faith and religion, neither can they with coherence to their own
grounds believe it themselves, nor require the belief of it of others,
without most high and most schismatical presumption.</i> Thus he: now I
suppose that either no Protestant Church or Synod will stile the Son's
coequal God-head with the Father a plain irrefragable, indubitable
Scripture, or consequence thereof, about which is, and hath been so
much contest, or with as much reason, they may call whatever points
they please such, however controverted, and then, what is said here
signifies nothing.</p>

<h3>§. 36.</h3>

<p><i>Prot.</i> Be not mistaken, I pray: especially concerning the Church of
<i>England</i>. For though she, for several Points, imposed formerly by the
Tyranny of the <i>Roman</i> Church, hath granted liberty of Opinion, or at
least freed her Subjects from obligation to believe so in them, as the
Church formerly required; yet as to exclusion of your Doctrin, she
professeth firmly to believe the three Creeds; and concerning the
Additions made in the two latter Creeds to the first, Dr. <i>Hammond</i><a
name="R_98" id="R_98" href="#N_98" class="nanchor">[98]</a>
acknowledgeth,&mdash;&mdash;<i>That they being thus settled by the
Universal Church, were, and still are in all reason, without
disputing, to be received and embraced by the Protestant Church, and
every meek Member thereof, with that reverence that is due to
Apostolick Truths; with that thankfulness which is our meet tribute to
those sacred Champions, for their seasonable, and provident propugning
our faith, with such timely and necessary application to practice,
that the Holy Ghost, speaking to us now, under the times of the New
Testament by the Governors of the Christian Churches, (Christs mediate
successors in the Prophetick, Pastoral, Episcopal Office) as he had
formerly spoken by the Prophets of the Old Testament, sent immediately
by him, may find a cheerful audience, and receive all uniform
submission from us.</i> Thus, Dr. <i>Hammond</i> of the Church of <i>England's</i>
assent to the three Creeds. She assenteth also to the definitions of
the four first General Councils: And the Act 1 <i>Eliz.</i><a name="R_99"
id="R_99" href="#N_99" class="nanchor">[99]</a> declares Heresie that,
which hath been adjudged so by them; now in the definitions of these 4
first General Councils your tenent hath received a Mortal wound. But
lastly, <i>the 4th</i> Canon in the English Synod held 1640.<a name="R_100"
id="R_100" href="#N_100" class="nanchor">[100]</a> particularly stiles
<i>Socinianism a most damnable and cursed Heresie, and contrary to the
Articles of Religion established in the Church of</i> England: <i>and
orders that any, convicted of it, be excommunicated and not absolved,
but upon his repentance and abjuration.</i> Now further than this
[<i>namely, excommunication upon conviction.</i>] No other Church I suppose
hath, or can proceed against your Heresie; It being received as a
common Axiom in the Canon law; that <i>Ecclesia non judicat de
occultis</i>,&mdash;&mdash;And&mdash;&mdash;<i>Cogitationis pænam nemo
patitur.</i>&mdash;&mdash;And&mdash;&mdash;<i>Ob peccatum mere internum
Ecclesiastica censura ferri non potest.</i> And in all Churches every
one, of what internal perswasion soever, continues externally at least
a member thereof, till the Church's censures do exclude him.</p>

<h3>§. 37.</h3>

<p><i>Soc.</i> The Church of <i>England</i> alloweth, assenteth to,
and teacheth, what she judgeth evident in the Scripture; for so she
ought; what she believes, or assenteth to, I look not after, but what
she enjoyns. Now I yield all that obedience in this point, that she
requires from me; and so I presume she will acknowledge me a dutiful
Son.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> What obedience when as you deny one of her chiefest,
and most fundamental doctrins?</p>

<p><i>Soc.</i> If I mistake not her principles, she requires of me no internal
belief or assent to any of her doctrins, but only, 1st. <i>Silence</i>, or
<i>non-contradiction</i> or 2ly, a <i>conditional belief</i>, <i>i.e.</i> whenever I
shall be convinced of the truth thereof. Now in both these I most
readily obey her. For the 1st, I have strictly observed it, kept my
opinion to my self; unless this my discourse with you hath been a
breach of it; but then I was at least a dutiful subject of this Church
at the beginning of our discourse; and for the 2d, whether <i>actual
conviction</i>, or <i>sufficient proposal</i>, be made the condition of my
assent, or submission of judgment, I am conscious to my self of no
disobedience, as to either of these; for an <i>actual conviction</i> I am
sure I have not: and, supposing, that I have had a <i>sufficient
proposal</i>, and do not know it, my obedience, upon the Protestant
principles, can possibly advance no further, than it now doth. The
<i>Apostles Creed</i> I totally embrace, and would have it the standing
bound of a Christian Faith. For other <i>Creeds</i>: I suppose, no more
belief is necessary to the Articles of the <i>Nicene Creed</i>, than is
required to those of the <i>Athanasian</i>. And, of what kind the necessity
is of believing those, Dr. <i>Stillingfleet</i> states on this manner <a
name="R_101" id="R_101" href="#N_101"
class="nanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>That the belief of a thing may be
supposed necessary, either as to the matter, because the matter is to
be believed in it self necessary; or because of the clear conviction
of mens understandings; that, though the matters be not in themselves
necessary, yet being revealed by God, they must be explicitly
believed: but then, the necessity of this belief doth extend no
further, than the clearness of the conviction doth.</i> Again, <i>that the
necessity of believing any thing arising from the Church's definition</i>
[upon which motive you seem to press the belief of the Article of
<i>Consubstantiality</i>] <i>doth depend upon the Conviction, that whatever
the Church defines is necessary to be believed. And, where that is not
received as an antecedent principle, the other cannot be supposed.</i>
[Now this principle neither I, nor yet Protestants, accept]. Then he
concludes&mdash;&mdash;<i>That as to the Athanasian Creed</i> [and the same
it is for the <i>Nicene</i>.] <i>It is unreasonable to imagine, that the
Church of</i> England <i>doth own this necessity, purely on the account of
the Church's definition of those things which are not fundamental, it
being directly contrary to her sense in her 19th and 20th Articles.</i>
[Now, which Articles of this Creed are not Fundamental, she defines
nothing; nor do the 19, 20, or 21. Articles own a necessity of
believing the Church's Definitions, even as to <i>Fundamentals</i>.] <i>And
hence, that the supposed necessity of the belief of the Articles of
the Athanasian Creed must, according to the sense of the Church of</i>
England, <i>be resolved, either into the necessity of the matters, or
into that necessity, which supposeth clear conviction, that the things
therein contained are of divine Revelation.</i> Thus he. Now, for so many
Articles as I am either convinced of the matter to be believed, that
it is in it self necessary; or, that they are divine Revelations, I do
most readily yield my Faith, and assent thereto. Now, to make some
Reply to the other things you have objected.</p>

<h3>§. 38.</h3>

<p>The Act 1 <i>Eliz.</i> allows no Definitions of the First General
Councils in declaring <i>Heresie</i>, but with this limitation, that,
in such Councils, such thing be declared <i>Heresie</i> by the express
and plain words of the <i>Canonical Scripture</i>. On which terms I
also accept them.</p>

<h3>§. 39.</h3>

<p>Dr. <i>Hammond</i>'s affirming, <i>That all additions settled by
the Universal Church</i> [he means General Councils] <i>are in all
reason, without disputing, to be received as Apostolical Truths, that
the Holy Ghost speaking to us by the Governors of the Christian
Churches, Christ's Successors, may receive all uniform submission from
us</i>, suits not with the Protestant Principles often formerly
mentioned.<a name="R_102" id="R_102" href="#N_102"
class="nanchor">[102]</a> For thus (if I rightly understand him) all
the definitions of General Councils, and of the Christian Governors in
all ages, as these being still Christ's Successors, are to be without
disputing, embraced as truths Apostolical.</p>

<h3>§. 40.</h3>

<p>If the words of the fourth <i>Canon</i> of the <i>English Synod</i>
1640. signifie any more, than this; That any person <i>convicted</i>
of Socinianism (<i>i. e.</i> by publishing his opinion) shall, upon
such conviction, be excommunicated; and if it be understood adequate
to this, <i>Qui non crediderit filium esse</i> <span
title="homoousion">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>
<i>Deo Patri, Anathema sit</i>, and, that the Church of <i>England</i>, for
allowing her Communion, is not content with <i>silence</i> in respect of
Socinianism, but obligeth men also to <i>assent</i> to the contrary; then,
I see not upon what good grounds such exclamation is made against the
like Anathema's or exactions of assent required by that of <i>Trent</i>, or
other late Councils, or by <i>Pius</i> his Bull. If it be said here, the
reason of such faulting them is, because these require assent, not
being lawful <i>General Councils</i>, such reason will not pass; 1st.
Because, neither the English Synod, exacting assent in this point, is
a General Council. 2ly. Because, it is the Protestant tenent, that
neither may lawful General Councils require <i>assent</i> to all their
Definitions. Or, if it be affirmed (either of <i>General</i> or
<i>Provincial</i> Councils) that they may require assent under Anathema to
some of their decrees; <i>viz.</i> Those evidently true, and divine
Revelations; such as <i>Consubstantiality</i> is; but may not to others;
<i>viz.</i> Those not manifested by them to be such; then, before we can
censure any Council for its Anathema's, or its requiring of assent, we
must know, whether the point, to which assent is required, is, or is
not, evident divine Revelation. And then, by whom, or how, shall this
thing touching the evidence of the Divine Revelation be judged or
decided? for those that judge this, whoever they be, do sit now upon
the trial of the rightness, or mistake of the judgment of a General
Council: Or when, think we, will those who judge this (<i>i.e.</i> every
person for himself) agree in their sentence? Again, If on the other
side, the <i>former Church</i> in her language, <i>Si quis non crediderit,
&amp;c. Anathema sit</i>, be affirmed (to which purpose the
fore-mentioned Axioms are urged by you) to mean nothing more, than,
<i>Si quis Hæresin suam palam profiteatur, &amp; hujus professionis
convictus fuerit, Anathema sit</i>, Thus the Protestants former quarrel
with her passing such <i>Anathema's</i> will be concluded causeless and
unjust. But indeed, though, (according to the former sentences,) her
Anathema is not extended to the internal act of holding such an
opinion, if wholly concealed, so far as to render such person for it
to stand <i>excommunicated</i>, and lie actually under this censure of the
Church, because hitherto no contempt of her authority appears, nor is
any dammage inferred to any other member of her Society thereby? Yet
her <i>Anathema</i> also extends, even to the internal act, or tenet, after
the Church's contrary definition known (which tenet also then is not
held without a disobedience, and contempt of her authority) so far, as
to render the delinquent therein guilty of a very great <i>mortal sin</i>;
and so at the same time internally cut off from being a true member of
<i>Christ's Body</i>; though externally he is not as yet so cut off. And
the Casuists further state him <i>ipso facto</i> to be excommunicated,
before, and without conviction, if externally he doth, or speaketh any
thing, whereby he is convincible; and not if there be any thing
<i>proved</i> against him, but if any thing at least <i>provable</i>; and such a
one, upon this, to be obliged in Conscience, not only to confess his
heretical opinion, for his being absolved from <i>mortal sin</i>; but also
to seek a release from excommunication incurred, for his re-enjoying
the Church's Communion. Thus you see a rigor in this Church towards
what it once accounted <i>Heresie</i> much different from the more mild
Spirit, and moderate temper of the <i>Reformed</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="S_41" id="S_41">§. 41.</a></h3>

<p>To conclude. For the enjoying the <i>Protestant</i> Communion, I conceive
that, as to any necessary approbation of her Doctrins, it is
sufficient for me to hold with Mr. <i>Chillingworth</i> (as I do<a
name="R_103" id="R_103" href="#N_103"
class="nanchor">[103]</a>)&mdash;&mdash;<i>That the Doctrin of Protestants,
though not that, of all of them, absolutely true, yet it is free from
all impiety, and from all Error destructive to Salvation, or in it
self damnable.</i> And <a name="R_104" id="R_104" href="#N_104"
class="nanchor">[104]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>whatsoever hath been held
necessary to Salvation by the consent of Protestants, or even of the
Church of</i> England, [which indeed hath given no certain Catalogue at
all of such <i>necessaries</i>], <i>that, against the Socinians, and all
others whatsoever, I do verily believe, and embrace</i>&mdash;&mdash;And
(which is still the same) <a name="R_105" id="R_105" href="#N_105"
class="nanchor">[105]</a>&mdash;<i>I am perswaded, that the constant doctrin
of the Church of</i> England, <i>is so pure and Orthodox, that whosoever
believes it, and lives according to it, undoubtedly he shall be
saved.</i> [For if all truths necessary to Salvation be held in it, then,
so, is no error, opposite or destructive to Salvation, held by it; and
so, living according to the truths it holds, I may be saved.] Again <a
name="R_106" id="R_106" href="#N_106"
class="nanchor">[106]</a>&mdash;&mdash;<i>I believe that there is no error
in it, which may necessitate, or warrant any man to disturb the peace,
or renounce the Communion of it</i>, [For, though I believe
<i>Antisocinianism</i>, an error; Yet if I hold it not such, as that for it
any man may disturb the peace, or ought to renounce the Communion of
the Church, I may profess all this, and yet hold Socinianism.] Lastly
as he,<a name="R_107" id="R_107" href="#N_107" class="nanchor">[107]</a>
so I;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Propose me any thing out of the Bible, seem it
never so incomprehensible, I will subscribe it with hand and heart. In
other things</i> [that I think not contained in this Book] <i>I will take
no mans liberty of judgment from him, neither shall any man take mine
from me; for I am fully assured, that God doth not, and therefore that
men ought not to require any more of any man than this; To believe the
Scripture to be Gods Word, to endeavour to find the true sense of it;
and to live according to it. Without pertinacy I can be no Heretick;
And<a name="R_108" id="R_108" href="#N_108" class="nanchor">[108]</a>,
endeavouring to find the true sense of Scripture, I cannot but hold my
error without pertinacy, and be ready to forsake it, when a more
true, and a more probable sense shall appear unto me.&mdash;&mdash;And
then, all necessary truth being plainly set down in Scripture, I am
certain by believing Scripture to believe all necessary truth; and in
doing so, my life being answerable to my Faith, how is it possible I
should fail of Salvation?</i> Thus Mr. <i>Chillingworth</i> speaks perfectly
my sense.</p>

<p><i>Prot.</i> I see no other cure for you; but that you learn
<i>humility</i> and <i>mortification</i> of your <i>Understanding</i>
(in which lies the most subtle and perilous of all <i>Prides</i>):
And, It will reduce you to <i>Obedience</i>: and this to <i>Truth</i>.
That, with all the Church of God, you may give glory to <i>God the
only begotten Son</i>, and <i>the Holy Ghost, coessential with God the
Father</i>. To which <i>Trinity</i> in <i>Unity</i>, as it hath been
from the beginning, and is now, so shall all Honour and Glory be given
throughout all future ages. <i>Amen.</i></p>
